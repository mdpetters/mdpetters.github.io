In this project, we will take advantage of emerging active remote sensing
approaches for the retrieval of vertical turbulent fluxes of particle mass and
chemical composition proxies. This will be achieved by combining two existing
remotely sensed instruments: a Doppler Lidar and the High Spectral Resolution
Lidar (HSRL). The derived flux values will be compared to in situ measurements
taken during the U.S. DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Field Campaign
at the Southern Great Planes (SGP) site in Oklahoma.
