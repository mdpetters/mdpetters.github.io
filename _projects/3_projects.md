Health impacts are usually quantified in terms of exposure to mass concentrations of particulate matter with
diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Sub-10 nm particles contribute negligible mass to atmospheric PM2.5. Yet they may
contribute strongly to the overall toxic dose delivered through the aerosol. The toxicity of sub-10 nm particles is
higher when compared to particles of larger size with the same composition. Sub-10 nm particles are readily
taken up by cells, can cross the skin barrier, air-blood barrier, and blood-brain barrier and in turn reach sensitive
organs. However, the paucity of information about their abundance, morphology, and toxicity has hampered
efforts to attribute their potential health effects with disease.

We have recently identified substantial direct emissions of sub-10 nm particles in an urban environment and
found that there are multiple temporally stable and spatially confined point sources within the city. It is unclear how
the toxicity of environmental sub-10 nm particles differ from engineered nanoparticles, and how the toxicity might
change upon release into the atmosphere. Current in in-vitro and in vivo exposure studies deliver milligrams of
material. In contrast, ambient concentrations of sub-10 nm particles are on the order of ng m−3 of air, making
collection of mg amounts unrealistic. In turn toxicology assessments through traditional methods are not possible.
This proposal addresses this challenge. **The specific aim is to obtain preliminary data from new methods
that can be used to evaluate the influence of sub-10 nm particles obtained from airborne samples at
atmospheric concentrations on living cells.**
