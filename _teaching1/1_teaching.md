#### **[Introduction to Computing in the Geosciences using MATLAB](https://mdpetters.github.io/MEA217/MEA_217_01.html)**

The course implements a flipped classroom approach. Lectures are broken into 5-10 min videos, 
followed by interactive formative questions and both formative and project-based programming 
exercises. I developed a complete electronic textbook that is free of charge to the enrolled 
students through TopHat. The textbooks presents the content in the form of (closed-captioned) instructional 
videos as well as more traditional text format. This accommodates visual, aural, and verbal 
learning styles. As students work through a chapter they receive instant feedback on
answering questions and can track progress via a progress bar. Students work on the problems 
either independently or in small groups during class period, depending on preference. 

The course is for students with little or no programming experience. It provides students 
with programming and problem solving skills using MATLAB with emphasis on the systematic 
development of algorithms and programs. Topics include Boolean math, data representation 
and types (array, vectors, strings, structures), evaluation of expressions, program control 
(iteration, functions), algorithm development (pseudo code, physical problem solving, 
numerical algorithms), basic MATLAB graphics, and limits of computing. Problems and projects 
are selected from the Geosciencese has no formal prerequisites. However, it is assumed that
students are proficient in solving algebraic equations, non-calculus Physics problems, and 
operating a computer.
