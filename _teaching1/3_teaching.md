#### **Atmspheric Aerosols**

This course is co-listed with CE 796. The course is offered during the spring semester on 
a biennial schedule. I have taught the course either alone (2011, 2013, 2020) or together with
Prof. Andy Grieshop (2015, 2018).

The course provides a graduate level introduction to the field of Aerosols in the Atmospheric and 
Environmental Sciences for graduate students. Topics include the microphysical characterization 
of aerosol; the motion in electrical and gravitational fields; principles of aerosol measurement; 
sources, evolution, sinks, and climatology of major aerosol types; aerosol thermodynamics;
 aerosol interaction with water; nucleation theory; aerosol-cloud-climate interactions. 

#### MEA 703 Course Level Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to do the following:

- Aerosol Behavior. Apply the equations that describe the aerosol size distribution and its moments (lognormal distribution, Hatch-Choate equations), aerosol motion in electrical and gravitational fields (thermophoresis, terminal velocity, stopping distance),  and aerosol interaction with radiation (scattering phase function, asymmetry parameter, Mie theory, single scatter albedo) 
- Measurements. Explain the basic principles of aerosol measurements (aerodynamic particle sizer, optical particle counter, nephelometer, single particle soot photometer).
- Aerosol climatology. Know the major physical and chemical characteristics, the sources, and global distributions of the different aerosol types (seasalt, sulfate, dust, organics, black carbon, bioaerosol). Explain the formation processes in terms of the underlying physical processes that lead to aerosol formation (bubble bursting, chemical reaction, mechanical production, thermodynamic equilibrium partitioning).
- Carbonaceous aerosols. Know the major sources and processes leading to organic and elemental/black carbon loadings in the atmosphere. Explain gas-particle partitioning of organics using absorptive partitioning theory and the volatility basis set. Have a basic understanding of several measurement methods applied to these species.
- Aerosol water interactions. Explain the observed interaction of aerosols with water (hygroscopic growth, cloud condensation nuclei, and ice nucleation) in terms of the underlying thermodynamic principles. 
- Modeling. Use Mie model. Apply parcel theory and basic aerosol properties (size distribution, Mie theory) to analyze the bidirectional interaction of populations of aerosols with clouds and precipitation. 
- Aerosol-climate-interactions. Critically evaluate subsets of the aerosol cloud interaction problem
