#### **Atmospheric Thermodynamics**

I taught this course annually between 2009 and 2017 and developed a complete self-contained course-pack. It is a 
traditional take on thermodynamics with the first half of the course focusing on fundamentals
(ideal gases, kinetic theory, adiabatic processes, work, heat, heat-engine, enthalpy, entropy, 
free energy,  phase transitions) and the second half on atmospheric topics (temperature measures such as dewpoint, wetbulb temperature, potential tempearture, isobaric cloud formation through mixing, layer thickness, adiabatic ascent, adiabatic cloud formation, and stability). The course assignments have meteorology 
majors in mind, with applications focusing on weather forecasting based on the 
thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere. 

### Example Content: Static Stability
The following example is and excerpt from Lecture 19 on atmospheric instability. 

#### Key Points
- Surface heating leads to the formation of a fully developed convective boundary layer. 
If the mixed layer becomes deep enough, and the surface is humid enough, fair-weather cumulus clouds form.

- The atmosphere conditionally unstable where the environmental lapse rate is greater than 
the saturated adiabatic lapse rate, but less than the dry adiabatic lapse rate. The condition 
for instability is that the air parcel is undergoing saturated adiabatic process.

- Potential instability occurs when a humid air underlies dry air and the entire 
column is lifted

#### Conditional Instability
The atmosphere conditionally unstable where the environmental lapse rate ($$\Gamma_e$$) is 
greater than the saturated adiabatic lapse rate ($$\Gamma_s$$), but less than the dry 
adiabatic lapse rate ($$\Gamma_d$$). The condition for instability is that the air parcel is
undergoing saturated adiabatic process.

- $$\Gamma_e < \Gamma_s$$ : absolutely stable
- $$\Gamma_e < \Gamma_s$$ : moist neutral
- $$\Gamma_d > \Gamma_e > \Gamma_s$$ : conditionally unstable
- $$\Gamma_e < \Gamma_d$$ : dry neutral
- $$\Gamma_e > \Gamma_d$$ : absolutely unstable

### MEA 312 Course Level Learning Outcomes 

#### Applied atmospheric thermodynamics
- Perform pressure-volume-temperature calculations for ideal gases. 
- Perform vapor equilibrium calculations for water vapor using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. 
- Calculate dry and moist adiabatic lapse rates for gases from the thermodynamic properties of dry and moist air. 
- Perform calculations of pressure-volume work following a prescribed thermodynamic path. 
- Calculate thermodynamic temperatures (e.g. potential temperature, isobaric equivalent potential temperature, wetbulb temperature) for a prescribed thermodynamic state. 
- Quantitatively solve text problems through deriving closed form solutions and numerical calculations. 
- Perform dimensional analysis and solve problems.

#### Computations 
- Use MATLAB to compute simple thermodynamic functions (e.g. convert fields of (p, T) to (z, q)). 
- Be able to graph basic thermodynamic functions (e.g. supersaturation with respect to ice vs. temperature). 
- Download thermodynamic data from the web and plot soundings. 
- Generate skew-T/log-p graphs in MATLAB.

- Be fluent in the use of procedural statements (assignments, conditional statements, loops, function calls) and arrays.

#### Explanations
- Use the formal framework of thermodynamics (first and second law, state variables U, H, S, G) to explain atmospheric phenomena such as:
    - Temperature variations with altitude
    - water vapor-liquid- solid phase transitions 
    - aqueous solution behavior
    - energetics of stratus cloud fields, cumulus convection hurricanes, and Hadley cells
