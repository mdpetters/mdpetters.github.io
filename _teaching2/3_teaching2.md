#### **Funamentals of Air Quality and Climate Change**

This course is an intermediate-level introduction, for meteorology majors, to the physical 
and chemical environment of the atmosphere and to climate change. Topics include the 
atmosphere's chemical composition; atmospheric chemical reaction processes in gas phase, 
liquid phase, and on particle surfaces.


#### MEA 312 Course Level Learning Outcomes

- Describe the properties of the past, current, and future global climate systems
using summary statics, frequency distributions, time-series, and global maps of
temperature, rainfall, stormtracks, frontal frequency, etc.
- Describe the sources, evolution, and sink of the tropospheric pollutants O 3 , VOCs
and particulate matter using chemical reaction mechanisms
- Create simple mathematical box models to compute the time-evolution of
chemicals
- Apply physical equations to quantify radiative fluxes and chemical reaction rates
- Explain how the physical laws governing radiation fluxes (Stefan-Boltzmann
law, Kirchhoffâ€™s law) and pollutant emissions result in climate forcing
- Create and execute simple radiation models to predict the Earth mean
temperature at radiative balance
- Evaluate the physical basis of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change assessment report
