<p><strong>Coronavirus Information </strong></span></p>
<p>Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, public health measures have been implemented across campus.  Students should stay current with these practices and expectations through the Protect the Pack website (</span><a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/">https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/</a>). The sections below provide expectations and conduct related to COVID-19 issues.</p>
<p><em>Health and Participation in Class</em> </span></p>
<p>We are most concerned about your health and the health of your classmates and instructors/TAs.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If you test positive for COVID-19, or are told by a healthcare provider that you are presumed positive for the virus,  please work with your instructor on health accommodations and follow other university guidelines, including self reporting (<a href="https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/">https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/</a>):  Self-reporting is not only to help provide support to you, but also to assist in contact tracing for containing the spread of the virus. </span></li>
<li>If you feel unwell, even if you have not been knowingly exposed to COVID-19, please do not come to class.</span></li>
<li>If you are in quarantine, have been notified that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, or have a personal or family situation related to COVID-19 that prevents you from attending this course in person (or synchronously), please connect with your instructor to discuss the situation and make alternative plans, as necessary. </span></li>
<li>If you need to make a request for an academic consideration related to COVID-19, such as a discussion about possible options for remote learning, please talk with your instructor for the appropriate process to make a COVID-19 request (a university-level form can be found here: <a href="https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1M44gQuByo2JTud">https://ncsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1M44gQuByo2JTud</a>).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Health and Well-Being Resources </em></span></p>
<p>These are difficult times, and academic and personal stress are natural results. Everyone is encouraged to take care of themselves and their peers. If you need additional support, there are many resources on campus to help you:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Counseling Center: <a href="https://counseling.dasa.ncsu.edu/">https://counseling.dasa.ncsu.edu/</a></span></li>
<li>Health Center: <a href="https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/">https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/</a></span></li>
<li>If the personal behavior of a classmate concerns or worries you, either for the classmate’s well-being or yours, we encourage you to report this behavior to the NC State CARES team:  (Share a Concern: <a href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?NCStateUniv&layout_id=2">https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?NCStateUniv&layout_id=2</a>). </span></li>
<li>If you or someone you know are experiencing food, housing or financial insecurity, please see the Pack Essentials Program (Pack Essentials: <a href="https://dasa.ncsu.edu/pack-essentials/">https://dasa.ncsu.edu/pack-essentials/</a>).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Community Standards related to COVID-19 </em></span></p>
<p>We are all responsible for protecting ourselves and our community.  Please see the community standards (released on 7/28/2020: </span><a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/reactivating-campus/community-standards/?%20utm_source=ALL+STAFF%2FFACULTY%2FSTUDENTS+-+UCOMM&utm_campaign=0d221175c9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_72820_Community_Standards&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e7a0fd0c9f-0d221175c9-92460566">https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/reactivating-campus/community-standards/?%20utm_source=ALL+STAFF%2FFACULTY%2FSTUDENTS+-+UCOMM&utm_campaign=0d221175c9-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_72820_Community_Standards&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_e7a0fd0c9f-0d221175c9-92460566</a>) and Rule 04.21.01 regarding Personal SafetyRequirements Related to COVID-19  RUL 04.21.01 – Personal Safety Requirements Related to COVID-19 – Policies, Regulations & Rules (</span><a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/rule/rul-04-21-01/">https://policies.ncsu.edu/rule/rul-04-21-01/</a>).</span></p>
<p><em>Course Expectations Related to COVID-19:</em></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Course Attendance: NC State attendance policies can be found at:  REG 02.20.03 – Attendance Regulations – Policies, Regulations & Rules (<a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03-attendance-regulations/">https://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03-attendance-regulations/</a>).  Please refer to the course’s attendance, absence, and deadline policies for additional details. If you are quarantined or otherwise need to miss class because you have been advised that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, you should not be penalized regarding attendance or class participation. However, you will be expected to develop a plan to keep up with your coursework during any such absences.  If you become ill with COVID-19, you should follow the steps outlined in the health and participation section above. COVID 19-related absences will be considered excused; documentation need only involve communication with your instructor. </span></li>
<li>Course Meeting Schedule: Your course might not have a traditional meeting schedule in Fall 2020.  Be sure to pay attention to any updates to the course schedule as the information in this syllabus may have changed. Please discuss any questions you have with the instructor. </span></li>
<li>Technology Requirements:  This course may require particular technologies to complete coursework.  Be sure to review the syllabus for these expectations, and see the syllabus technology requirements for your course: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bfrka-Y4qm3WouAGOnCm0YBAytykTjQjvEBErBkNDgc/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bfrka-Y4qm3WouAGOnCm0YBAytykTjQjvEBErBkNDgc/edit</a>. If you need access to additional technological support, please contact the Libraries’ Technology Lending Service: <a href="https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices">https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/devices</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Course Delivery Changes Related to COVID-19 </em></span></p>
<p>Please be aware that the situation regarding COVID-19 is frequently changing, and the delivery mode of this course may need to change accordingly, including from in-person to online.  Regardless of the delivery method, we will strive to provide a high-quality learning experience. </span></p>
<p><em>Grading/Scheduling Changing Options Related to COVID-19 </em></span></p>
<p>If the delivery mode has a negative impact on your academic performance in this course, the university has provided tools to potentially reduce the impact:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced S/U Grading Option: </span><a href="https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-sat-grading/">https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-sat-grading/</a></li>
<li>Enhanced Late Drop: </span><a href="https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-latedrop/">https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-latedrop/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, another option may be to request an incomplete in the course. Before using any of these tools, discuss the options with your instructor and your academic advisor. Be aware that if you use the enhanced S/U, you will still need to complete the course and receive at least a C- to pass the course. </span></p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Curve Policy </strong></span></p>
<p>All quizzes and exams will be closed book, closed notes. Students who with a documented excuse that are unable to take the test at those times will schedule an alternate time to take the quiz with the instructor. I reserve the right to assign grades using a curve, should the class average be lower than expected. </span></p>
<p><strong>However, if I were to apply a curve, I would never reduce your grade. If you earned an 95/100 without a curve, you earned at minimum an A. </strong></span></p>
<p>In case I apply a curve, I take all of the total scores for the class and make a grade distribution. I then compute the average and standard deviation of the distribution. The mean score corresponds to a B- in the course. I then assign the rest of the grades by looking at both the standard deviation around the mean and by looking for natural breaks. The important question is how do I assign A's and D’s and F's? An A grade means someone has demonstrated superior knowledge of the course material. Hence, I only assign an A grade to students who have mastered of course content at the highest level that can reasonably be expected. For students that are on the cusp, I will honor effort. If you come to class, ask questions, are engaged in class, and study the memorization questions you should not receive a D.</span></p>

<h4>Requirements for Credit-Only (S/U) Grading</h4>
<div class="text">
<p>In order to receive a grade of S, students are required to take all exams and quizzes, complete all assignments, and earn a grade of C- or better. Conversion from letter grading to credit only (S/U) grading is subject to university deadlines. Refer to the Registration and Records calendar for deadlines related to grading. For more details refer to <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15">http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-15</a>.</p>
