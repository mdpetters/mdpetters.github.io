	abstract = {Electrostatic precipitators are devices that remove charged particles from an air stream. We present the design and characterization of an electrostatic precipitator that is intended to be incorporated into aerosol sampling equipment. Hardware and software components of the design are open, all components can be directly purchased from vendors, and the device can be assembled with standard tools. Generic components are used to allow the repurposing of parts for other uses. The computer-controlled high-voltage power supply box associated with the project can be used for other common high-voltage applications in Aerosol Science and Technology, such as data acquisition and control systems for scanning mobility particle sizers. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to quantify the 3D flow field. The transfer function associated with the partial transmission is characterized through modeling and experiments. The observed transfer function is unique but deviates from the ideal transfer function due to the distortion of the flow near the inlet and the outlet of the device. Singly charged particles up to 624 nm and 253 nm can be completely removed for 0.5 L min−1 and 1 L min−1, respectively. We anticipate that our device will increase the accessibility of the technique to a broader audience.}

	abstract = {Tikhonov regularization is a tool for reducing noise amplification during data inversion. This work introduces RegularizationTools.jl, a general-purpose software package for applying Tikhonov regularization to data. The package implements well-established numerical algorithms and is suitable for systems of up to ~1000 equations. Included is an abstraction to systematically categorize specific inversion configurations and their associated hyperparameters. A generic interface translates arbitrary linear forward models defined by a computer function into the corresponding design matrix. This obviates the need to explicitly write out and discretize the Fredholm integral equation, thus facilitating fast prototyping of new regularization schemes associated with measurement techniques. Example applications include the inversion involving data from scanning mobility particle sizers (SMPSs) and humidified tandem differential mobility analyzers (HTDMAs). Inversion of SMPS size distributions reported in this work builds upon the freely available software DifferentialMobilityAnalyzers.jl. The speed of inversion is improved by a factor of ~200, now requiring between 2 and 5 ms per SMPS scan when using 120 size bins. Previously reported occasional failure to converge to a valid solution is reduced by switching from the L-curve method to generalized cross-validation as the metric to search for the optimal regularization parameter. Higher-order inversions resulting in smooth, denoised reconstructions of size distributions are now included in DifferentialMobilityAnalyzers.jl. This work also demonstrates that an SMPS-style matrixbased inversion can be applied to find the growth factor frequency distribution from raw HTDMA data while also accounting for multiply charged particles. The outcome of the aerosol-related inversion methods is showcased by inverting multi-week SMPS and HTDMA datasets from ground-based observations, including SMPS data obtained at Bodega Marine Laboratory during the CalWater 2/ACAPEX campaign and co-located SMPS and HTDMA data collected at the US Department of Energy observatory located at the Southern Great Plains site in Oklahoma, USA. Results show that the proposed approaches are suitable for unsupervised, nonparametric inversion of large-scale datasets as well as inversion in real time during data acquisition on low-cost reducedinstruction- set architectures used in single-board computers. The included software implementation of Tikhonov regularization is freely available, general, and domain-independent and thus can be applied to many other inverse problems arising in atmospheric measurement techniques and beyond.}

The material is appropriate for upper-level undergraduate and graduate instruction with pedagogy based on process-oriented guided inquiry learning. Students playfully interact with physical relationships and atmospheric models. Two examples are the interaction with an aerosol–cloud parcel model for simulating the early stage of cloud formation and the interaction with the Bowen model for simulating the formation of rain by coalescence. Photos, text, figures, and software associated with the project are free to be shared and free to be adapted. In addition to focusing on discipline-based learning objectives, the worksheets emphasize interacting with real-world data and practicing graph comprehension. Hosting the content in the cloud ensures reliable and scalable delivery to any device with a browser and Internet access. The worksheets are designed to be used in a student-centered active learning classroom but can also be used in an online setting."

	ABSTRACT = {Atmospheric aerosols can exist in amorphous semi-solid or glassy phase states whose viscosity varies with atmospheric temperature and relative humidity. The temperature and humidity dependence of viscosity has been hypothesized to be predictable from the combination of a water-organic binary mixing rule of the glass transition temperature, a glass transition temperature scaled viscosity fragility parameterization, and a water uptake parameterization. This work presents a closure study between predicted and observed viscosity for sucrose and citric acid. Viscosity and glass transition temperature as a function of water content are compiled from literature data and used to constrain the fragility parameterization. New measurements characterizing viscosity of sub-100 nm particles using the dimer relaxation method are presented. These measurements extend the available data of temperature and humidity dependent viscosity to −28 ºC. Predicted relationships agree well with observations at room temperature and with measured isopleths of constant viscosity at ~107 Pa s and warmer than −28 ºC. Discrepancies at colder temperatures are observed for sucrose particle. Simulations with the kinetic multi-layer model of gas-particle interactions suggest that the observed deviations at colder temperature for sucrose can be attributed to kinetic limitations associated with water uptake at the timescales of the dimer relaxation experiments. Using the available information, updated equilibrium phase-state diagrams (−80 ºC < T < 40 ºC and 0 < RH < 100 %) for sucrose and citric acid are constructed and associated equilibration timescales are identified.},

Sub-10 nm particles are of additional interest due to their health effects and contribution to particle growth processes. Ambient measurements were carried out at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC between April to June 2019 and November 2019 to May 2020 to investigate the temporal variability of size distribution and number concentration of ultrafine particles. A mobile lab was deployed between March and May 2020 to characterize the spatial distribution of sub-10 nm particle number concentration. New particle formation and growth events were observed regularly. Also observed were direct emissions of sub-10 nm particles. Analysis against meteorological variables, gas-phase species, and particle concentrations show that the sub-10nm particles dominated number concentration during periods of low planetary boundary layer height, low solar radiation, and northeast winds. The spatial patterns observed during mobile deployments suggest that multiple temporally stable and spatially confined point sources of sub-10 nm particles are present within the city. These sources likely include the campus utility plants and the Raleigh-Durham International Airport. Additionally, the timing of data collection allowed for investigation of variations in the urban aerosol number size distribution due to reduced economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic."

	abstract = {Atmospheric aerosols can assume liquid, amorphous semi-solid or glassy, and crystalline phase states. Particle phase state plays a critical role in understanding and predicting aerosol impacts on human health, visibility, cloud formation, and climate. Melting point depression increases with decreasing particle diameter and is predicted by the Gibbs–Thompson relationship. This work reviews existing data on the melting point depression to constrain a simple parameterization of the process. The parameter ξ describes the degree to which particle size lowers the melting point and is found to vary between 300 and 1800 K nm for a wide range of particle compositions. The parameterization is used together with existing frameworks for modeling the temperature and RH dependence of viscosity to predict the influence of particle size on the glass transition temperature and viscosity of secondary organic aerosol formed from the oxidation of α-pinene. Literature data are broadly consistent with the predictions. The model predicts a sharp decrease in viscosity for particles less than 100 nm in diameter. It is computationally efficient and suitable for inclusion in models to evaluate the potential influence of the phase change on atmospheric processes. New experimental data of the size-dependence of particle viscosity for atmospheric aerosol mimics are needed to thoroughly validate the predictions.},

Here, INP concentrations in rainwater from Northern India and a dust sample from the Thar Desert are characterized. Rainwater INP concentrations ranged between 10e4 and 3 × 10e7 L−1 water, spanning temperatures between −4 and −28 °C. During the monsoon season, INP concentrations were low and approached those in remote marine air mass. During the winter season, INPs active between −4 to −10 °C were occasionally observed. An increase in INP activity sometimes occurred after the initial onset of rain. The onset freezing temperature of samples active at warmer temperatures was shifted to colder temperature after heat treatment, suggesting that the INP activity stemmed from biological influence. Plating was used to isolate and sequence INP active bacterial strains from some of the rainwater samples, specifically strains of close taxonomic affiliation with the ice nucleating genera Pantoea. The size-resolved ice nucleation active site density for 200–600-nm particles of Thar Desert Dust ranged between 10e7 and 10e9 m−2 at −20 °C, values similar to dusts from other regions of the world. The data reported herein may help constrain models that seek to predict the impact of INP on the properties of mixed-phased clouds over the Indian subcontinent.},

Here we show the existence of two distinct sources. The first source was detectable during morning and afternoon rush hours and was defined by high black carbon concentrations. Particle number concentration inversely correlated with the local planetary boundary layer height. The particle size distributions were characterized by a wide range of modal diameters and did not exhibit detectable modal growth. This source was attributed to vehicular emissions. The second source yielded particle number concentration comparable to those during the rush hours and was detected six times over the 3-week measurement campaign. Small particles produced by this source were recorded during the midday after the diminishment of the rush-hour traffic effects. The particles exhibited prolonged modal growth over 8 hr, which may indicate a regional scale nucleation event. The data suggest that these particles were likely formed above the nocturnal boundary layer after sunrise and were subsequently transported to the surface through convective mixing. Overall, the nocturnal and convective boundary layer evolution was found to be closely associated with the of small particle event and the most important factor affecting the ground-level particle number concentration. Shallow nocturnal boundary layers trapped pollution near the ground leading to particle number concentrations over 104 cm−3.},

	abstract = {Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a complex mixture of largely unspeciated compounds. The volatility and viscosity of the bulk organic aerosol influence new particle formation, processing, and lifetime in the atmosphere. Relationships between these properties are well-defined for pure compounds but currently unavailable for bulk organic aerosol. In this survey study, we characterized SOA formed from a range of biogenic precursors and conditions in an oxidation flow reactor for volatility (thermodenuder), viscosity (dimer coagulation, isolation, and coalescence), and oxidation state (aerosol chemical speciation monitor). We find linear trends in log–linear and log–log plots of single-parameter representations of volatility and viscosity, with higher condensed-phase fractions of extremely low and low volatility material associated with an increased viscosity (R = 0.69). Per this relationship, an increase in the contribution of these fractions (i.e., lower volatility) by 0.1 results in an increase in viscosity of approximately 200%. The viscosity (at 30 °C) of SOA fell between 6.2 × 105 and 8.0 × 108 Pa s and thus in the semisolid range. The SOA oxidation state ranged from −1.0 and 0.1 and was weakly anticorrelated with volatility (but not viscosity). We found larger SOA mass loadings generally associated with increased volatility and decreased viscosity. The results of this preliminary study are consistent with “molecular corridor”-style frameworks employing molecular mass and volatility to estimate the viscosity of bulk real-world SOA.}

	ABSTRACT = {Nanoscale dimers have application in studies of aerosol physicochemical properties such as aerosol viscosity. These particle dimers can be synthesized using the dual tandem differential mobility analyzer (DTDMA) technique, wherein oppositely charged particle streams coagulate to form dimers that can be isolated using electrostatic filtration. Although some characterization of the technique has been published, a detailed thesis on the modes and theory of operation has remained outside the scope of prior work. Here, we present new experimental data characterizing the output DTDMA size distribution and the physical processes underlying its apparent modes. Key experimental limitations for both general applications and for viscosity measurements are identified and quantified in six distinct types of DTDMA experiments. The primary consideration is the production of an adequate number of dimers, which typically requires high mobility-selected number concentration in the range 25,000–100,000 cm−3. The requisite concentration threshold depends upon the rate of spontaneous monomer decharging, which arises predominately from interactions of the aerosol with ionizing radiation within the coagulation chamber and is instrument location dependent. Lead shielding of the coagulation chamber reduced the first-order decharging constant from ∼2.0 × 10−5 s−1 to ∼0.8 × 10−5 s−1 in our laboratory. Dimer production at monomer diameters less than 40 nm is hindered by low bipolar charging efficiency. Results from the characterization experiments shed light on design considerations for general applications and for characterization of viscous aerosol phase transitions.}

	ABSTRACT = {Aerosol particle and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) measurements from a littoral location on the northern coast of California at Bodega Bay Marine Laboratory (BML) are presented for approximately six weeks of observations during the boreal winter–spring as part of the CalWater-2015 field campaign. The nature and variability of surface (marine boundary layer, MBL) aerosol populations were evaluated by classifying observations into periods of similar aerosol and meteorological characteristics using an unsupervised cluster model to derive distinct littoral aerosol population types and link them to source regions. Such classifications support efforts to understand the impact of changing aerosol properties on precipitation and cloud development in the region, including during important atmospheric river (AR) tropical moisture advection events. Eight aerosol population types were identified that were associated with a range of impacts from both marine and terrestrial sources. Average measured total particle number concentrations, size distributions, hygroscopicities, and activated fraction spectra between 0.08 % and 1.1 % supersaturation are given for each of the identified aerosol population types, along with meteorological observations and transport pathways during time periods associated with each type. Five terrestrially influenced aerosol population types represented different degrees of aging of the continental outflow from the coast and interior of California, and their appearance at the BML site was often linked to changes in wind direction and transport pathways. In particular, distinct aerosol populations, associated with diurnal variations in source regions induced by land- and sea-breeze shifts, were classified by the clustering technique. A terrestrial type representing fresh emissions, and/or a recent new particle formation event, occurred in approximately 10 % of the observations. Over the entire study period, three marine-influenced population types were identified that typically occurred when the regular diurnal land and sea-breeze cycle collapsed and BML was continuously ventilated by air masses from marine regions for multiple days. These marine types differed from each other primarily in the degree of cloud processing evident in the size distributions, and in the presence of an additional large-particle mode for the type associated with the highest wind speeds. One of the marine types was associated with a multi-day period during which an atmospheric river made landfall at BML. Differences between many of the terrestrial and marine population types in total CCN number concentrations active at a specific supersaturation were often not as pronounced as the associated differences in the corresponding activated fraction spectra, particularly for supersaturations below about 0.4 %. This finding was due to the generally higher number concentrations in terrestrial air masses offsetting the lower fraction of particles activating at low supersaturations. At higher supersaturations, CCN concentrations for aged terrestrial types were typically above those of the marine types due to their higher number concentrations.},

	ABSTRACT = {We present the laboratory results of immersion freezing efficiencies of cellulose particles at supercooled temperature (T) conditions. Three types of chemically homogeneous cellulose samples are used as surrogates that represent supermicron and submicron ice-nucleating plant structural polymers. These samples include microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), fibrous cellulose (FC) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC). Our immersion freezing dataset includes data from various ice nucleation measurement techniques available at 17 different institutions, including nine dry dispersion and 11 aqueous suspension techniques. With a total of 20 methods, we performed systematic accuracy and precision analysis of measurements from all 20 measurement techniques by evaluating T-binned (1 ∘C) data over a wide T range (−36 ∘C <T<−4 ∘C). Specifically, we intercompared the geometric surface area-based ice nucleation active surface site (INAS) density data derived from our measurements as a function of T, ns,geo(T). Additionally, we also compared the ns,geo(T) values and the freezing spectral slope parameter (Δlog(ns,geo)/ΔT) from our measurements to previous literature results. Results show all three cellulose materials are reasonably ice active. The freezing efficiencies of NCC samples agree reasonably well, whereas the diversity for the other two samples spans ≈ 10 ∘C. Despite given uncertainties within each instrument technique, the overall trend of the ns,geo(T) spectrum traced by the T-binned average of measurements suggests that predominantly supermicron-sized cellulose particles (MCC and FC) generally act as more efficient ice-nucleating particles (INPs) than NCC with about 1 order of magnitude higher ns,geo(T).},

	ABSTRACT = {Particles composed of organic and inorganic components can assume core-shell morphologies. The kinetic limitation of water uptake due to the presence of a hydrophobic viscous outer shell may increase the critical supersaturation required to activate such particles into cloud droplets. Here we test this hypothesis through laboratory experiments. Results show that the viscosity of polyethylene particles is 5×106 Pa s at 60 ∘C. Extrapolation of temperature dependent viscosity measurements suggests that the particles are glassy at room temperature. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity measurements demonstrate that pure polyethylene particles are CCN inactive at diameters less than 741 nm and 2.5 % water supersaturation. Thus, polyethylene is used as proxy for hydrophobic glassy organic material. Ammonium sulfate is used as proxy for hygroscopic CCN active inorganic material. Mixed particles were generated using coagulation of oppositely charged particles; charge-neutral polyethylene–ammonium sulfate dimer particles were then isolated for online observation. Morphology of these dimer particles was varied by heating, such that liquefied polyethylene partially or completely engulfed the ammonium sulfate. Critical supersaturation was measured as a function of dry particle volume, particle morphology, and organic volume fraction. The data show that kinetic limitations do not change the critical supersaturation of 50 nm ammonium sulfate cores coated with polyethylene and polyethylene volume fractions up to 97 %. Based on these results, and a synthesis of literature data, it is suggested that mass transfer limitations by glassy organic shells are unlikely to affect cloud droplet activation near laboratory temperatures.},

Viscosity was measured using coalescence time scales of synthesized 100 nm dimers. Dry temperature-dependent SOA viscosity was similar to that of citric acid, coal tar pitch, and sorbitol. The temperature where dry viscosity was 106 Pa·s varied between 14 and 36 °C and extrapolated glass transition varied between −10 and 20 °C (±10 °C). Mass fragment f44 obtained with an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor was anticorrelated with viscosity. Viscosity of humidified Δ3-carene and α-pinene SOAs exceeded 106 Pa·s for all subsaturated RHs at temperatures <0 and –5 °C, respectively. Steep viscosity isopleths at 106 Pa·s were traced for these across (temperature, RH) conditions ranging from (approximately −5 °C, 100\%) and (approximately 36 °C, 0\%). Differences in composition and thus hygroscopicity can shift humidified viscosity isopleths for SOAs at cold tropospheric temperatures.},

	ABSTRACT = {Aerosol particles strongly influence global climate by modifying the properties of clouds. An accurate assessment of the aerosol impact on climate requires knowledge of the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), a subset of aerosol particles that can activate and form cloud droplets in the atmosphere. Atmospheric particles typically consist of a myriad of organic species, which frequently dominate the particle composition. As a result, CCN concentration is often a strong function of the hygroscopicity of organics in the particles. Earlier studies showed organic hygroscopicity increases nearly linearly with oxidation level. Such an increase in hygroscopicity is conventionally attributed to higher water solubility for more oxidized organics. By systematically varying the water content of activating droplets, we show that for the majority of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), essentially all organics are dissolved at the point of droplet activation. Therefore, for droplet activation, the organic hygroscopicity is not limited by solubility but is dictated mainly by the molecular weight of organic species. Instead of increased water solubility as previously thought, the increase in the organic hygroscopicity with oxidation level is largely because (1) SOAs formed from smaller precursor molecules tend to be more oxidized and have lower average molecular weight and (2) during oxidation, fragmentation reactions reduce average organic molecule weight, leading to increased hygroscopicity. A simple model of organic hygroscopicity based on molecular weight, oxidation level, and volatility is developed, and it successfully reproduces the variation in SOA hygroscopicity with oxidation level observed in the laboratory and field studies.},

	abstract = {A new cloud parcel model (CPM) including activation, condensation, collision–coalescence, and lateral entrainment processes is used to investigate aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs) in cumulus development prior to rainfall onset. The CPM was applied with surface aerosol measurements to predict the vertical structure of cloud development at early stages, and the model results were evaluated against airborne observations of cloud microphysics and thermodynamic conditions collected during the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) in the inner region of the southern Appalachian Mountains (SAM). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the model response to variations in key ACI physiochemical parameters and initial conditions. The CPM sensitivities mirror those found in parcel models without entrainment and collision–coalescence, except for the evolution of the droplet spectrum and liquid water content with height. Simulated cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs) exhibit high sensitivity to variations in the initial aerosol concentration at cloud base, but weak sensitivity to bulk aerosol hygroscopicity. The condensation coefficient ac plays a governing role in determining the evolution of CDNC, liquid water content (LWC), and cloud droplet spectra (CDS) in time and with height. Lower values of ac lead to higher CDNCs and broader CDS above cloud base, and higher maximum supersaturation near cloud base. Analysis of model simulations reveals that competitive interference among turbulent dispersion, activation, and droplet growth processes modulates spectral width and explains the emergence of bimodal CDS and CDNC heterogeneity in aircraft measurements from different cloud regions and at different heights. Parameterization of nonlinear interactions among entrainment, condensational growth, and collision–coalescence processes is therefore necessary to simulate the vertical structures of CDNCs and CDSs in convective clouds. Comparisons of model predictions with data suggest that the representation of lateral entrainment remains challenging due to the spatial heterogeneity of the convective boundary layer and the intricate 3-D circulations in mountainous regions.},

Major breakthroughs in measurement capabilities and in theoretical understanding have elucidated the characteristics of cloud condensation nuclei and ice nucleating particles and the role these play in shaping cloud microphysical properties and the formation of precipitation. Despite these advances, not all their impacts on cloud formation and evolution have been resolved. The resulting radiative forcing on the climate system due to aerosol–cloud interactions remains an unacceptably large uncertainty in future climate projections. Process-level understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions remains insufficient to support technological mitigation strategies such as intentional weather modification or geoengineering to accelerating Earth-system-wide changes in temperature and weather patterns.",

	abstract = {A language for computation of differential mobility analyzer (DMA) response functions is introduced. The language consists of short programming language expressions that evaluate to the size distribution of particles exiting a DMA. The language permits application of the same framework to single and tandem DMA setups. Expressions are derived for calculation of the convolution matrix used in inversion of size distribution data, calculation of the convolution matrix for transit through tandem DMA systems, and calculation of the size and mobility distribution through DMA systems that involve one or multiple DMAs. The contribution of multiply charged particles to the total response distributions can be explicitly resolved. The derived convolution matrix is suitable for inverting scanning mobility particle sizer response functions using standard regularization techniques. Users can modify and substitute any of the convolution terms—comprising the DMA transfer function, detector efficiency, loss rate, and charging efficiencies—to express response functions of nonstandard DMA configurations. Example applications are presented, including classification of particle size, measurement of size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei activity, characterization of hygroscopicity and volatility tandem DMA response functions, and characterization of the dual tandem DMA system for dimer preparation. The source code and examples are shared as free software and are hosted on an online collaborative software development platform that allows for version tracking and crediting contributors. Adoption of the language may facilitate the design and optimization of custom-built systems that involve unique arrangements of DMAs and detectors.},

The timescale for growth is important to establish for particles undergoing hydration processes in the atmosphere or during inhalation. Using an electrodynamic balance, we report direct measurements at −7.5, 0, and 20 °C of timescales for hygroscopic condensational growth on a range of model hygroscopic aerosol systems. These extend from viscous aerosol particles containing a single saccharide solute (sucrose, glucose, raffinose, or trehalose) and a starting viscosity equivalent to a glass of ∼1012 Pa·s, to nonviscous (∼10–2 Pa·s) tetraethylene glycol particles. The condensation timescales observed in this work indicate that water condensation occurs rapidly at all temperatures examined (<10 s) and for particles of all initial viscosities spanning 10–2 to 1012 Pa·s. Only a marginal delay (<1 order of magnitude) is observed for particles starting as a glass.}

	abstract = {Abstract Atmospheric measurements of aerosol size-resolved hygroscopicity at submicron sizes are carried out at the United States Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility in Duck, North Carolina. The scientific aim of the field deployment is to gain improved understanding of the springtime advection of aerosols from the East Coast of the United States over the Atlantic and help to constrain assessments of anthropogenic particle contributions to the marine boundary layer aerosol budget. Air mass back trajectories show that the aerosol sampled at the coast is largely of continental origin that either gets transported directly from the land or spends some time over the Atlantic Ocean. Aerosol size-resolved hygroscopicity measurements are consistent with air masses of both continental and marine background that are heavily influenced by the continental outflow. Aitken and accumulation mode mean diameters range from 49.1 ± 1.7 nm to 66.9 ± 0.8 nm and 142.8 ± 1.1 nm to 155.0 ± 2.8 nm, respectively. Hygroscopicity distributions for 96 nm, 188 nm, and 284 nm dry-sized particles show the mode hygroscopicity parameter range from 0.20 ± 0.01 to 0.54 ± 0.03, suggesting the presence of anthropogenic aerosols. We have used the method described by Royalty et al. (2017) to decompose the hygroscopicity distributions into three distinct classes based on the ambient aerosol hygroscopic properties relative to the hygroscopic properties of a reference compound. The method shows that continental outflow heavily influences aerosol chemical and physical properties at the East Coast, with hygroscopicities of submicron aerosols consistent with sulfate-containing species (62\% to 83\%), with small contributions from sodium- and carbon-containing particles (up to 9\% and 37\%, respectively).},

Here, we present the design, testing, and analysis of data collected through the first instrument capable of measuring hygroscopicity-based, size-resolved particle fluxes using a continuous-flow Hygroscopicity-Resolved Relaxed Eddy Accumulation (Hy-Res REA) technique. The Hy-Res REA system used in this study includes a 3D sonic anemometer, two fast-response solenoid valves, two condensation particle counters, a scanning mobility particle sizer, and a hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer. The different components of the instrument were tested inside the US Environmental Protection Agency's Aerosol Test Facility for sodium chloride and ammonium sulfate particle fluxes. The new REA system design does not require particle accumulation, and therefore avoids the diffusional wall losses associated with long residence times of particles inside the air collectors of traditional REA devices. A linear relationship was found between the sodium chloride particle fluxes measured by eddy covariance and REA techniques. The particle detection limit of the Hy-Res REA flux system is estimated to be ∼3 × 105 m−2 s−1. The estimated sodium chloride particle classification limit, for the mixture of sodium chloride and ammonium sulfate particles of comparable concentrations, is ∼6 × 106 m−2 s−1.}

	abstract = {Abstract The impact of anthropogenic aerosol on climate forcing remains uncertain largely due to inadequate representation of natural aerosols in climate models. The marine boundary layer (MBL) might serve as a model location to study natural aerosol processes. Yet source and sink mechanisms controlling the MBL aerosol number, size distribution, chemical composition, and hygroscopic properties remain poorly constrained. Here aerosol size distribution and water uptake measurements were made aboard the R/V Hi'ialakai from 27 June to 3 July 2016 in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. Size distributions were predominantly bimodal with an average integrated number concentration of 197 ± 98 cm−3. Hygroscopic growth factors were measured using the tandem differential mobility analyzer technique for dry 48, 96, and 144 nm particles. Mode kappa values for these were 0.57 ± 0.12, 0.51 ± 0.09, and 0.52 ± 0.08, respectively. To better understand remote MBL aerosol sources, a new algorithm was developed which decomposes hygroscopicity distributions into three classes: carbon-containing particles, sulfate-like particles, and sodium-containing particles. Results from this algorithm showed low and steady sodium-containing particle concentrations while the sulfate-like and carbon-containing particle concentrations varied during the cruise. According to the classification scheme, carbon-containing particles contributed at least 3–7\%, sulfate-like particles contributed at most 77–88\% and sodium-containing particles at least contributed 9–16\% to the total aerosol number concentration. Size distribution and hygroscopicity data, in conjunction with air mass back trajectory analysis, suggested that the aerosol budget in the subtropical North Pacific MBL may be controlled by aerosol entrainment from the free troposphere.},

	abstract = {A number of new measurement methods for ice nucleating particles (INPs) have been introduced in recent years, and it is important to address how these methods compare. Laboratory comparisons of instruments sampling major INP types are common, but few comparisons have occurred for ambient aerosol measurements exploring the utility, consistency and complementarity of different methods to cover the large dynamic range of INP concentrations that exists in the atmosphere. In this study, we assess the comparability of four offline immersion freezing measurement methods (Colorado State University ice spectrometer, IS; North Carolina State University cold stage, CS; National Institute for Polar Research Cryogenic Refrigerator Applied to Freezing Test, CRAFT; University of British Columbia micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor–droplet freezing technique, MOUDI-DFT) and an online method (continuous flow diffusion chamber, CFDC) used in a manner deemed to promote/maximize immersion freezing, for the detection of INPs in ambient aerosols at different locations and in different sampling scenarios. We also investigated the comparability of different aerosol collection methods used with offline immersion freezing instruments. Excellent agreement between all methods could be obtained for several cases of co-sampling with perfect temporal overlap. Even for sampling periods that were not fully equivalent, the deviations between atmospheric INP number concentrations measured with different methods were mostly less than 1 order of magnitude. In some cases, however, the deviations were larger and not explicable without sampling and measurement artifacts. Overall, the immersion freezing methods seem to effectively capture INPs that activate as single particles in the modestly supercooled temperature regime (> −20 °C), although more comparisons are needed in this temperature regime that is difficult to access with online methods. Relative to the CFDC method, three immersion freezing methods that disperse particles into a bulk liquid (IS, CS, CRAFT) exhibit a positive bias in measured INP number concentrations below −20 °C, increasing with decreasing temperature. This bias was present but much less pronounced for a method that condenses separate water droplets onto limited numbers of particles prior to cooling and freezing (MOUDI-DFT). Potential reasons for the observed differences are discussed, and further investigations proposed to elucidate the role of all factors involved.},

	abstract = {The albedo and microphysical properties of clouds are controlled in part by the hygroscopicity of particles serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Hygroscopicity of complex organic mixtures in the atmosphere varies widely and remains challenging to predict. Here we present new measurements characterizing the CCN activity of pure compounds in which carbon chain length and the numbers of hydroperoxy, carboxyl, and carbonyl functional groups were systematically varied to establish the contributions of these groups to organic aerosol apparent hygroscopicity. Apparent hygroscopicity decreased with carbon chain length and increased with polar functional groups in the order carboxyl > hydroperoxy > carbonyl. Activation diameters at different supersaturations deviated from the −3/2 slope in log–log space predicted by Köhler theory, suggesting that water solubility limits CCN activity of particles composed of weakly functionalized organic compounds. Results are compared to a functional group contribution model that predicts CCN activity of organic compounds. The model performed well for most compounds but underpredicted the CCN activity of hydroperoxy groups. New best-fit hydroperoxy group/water interaction parameters were derived from the available CCN data. These results may help improve estimates of the CCN activity of ambient organic aerosols from composition data.}

	abstract  ="Atmospheric aerosols can exist in amorphous semi-solid or glassy phase states. These states are determined by the temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH). New measurements of viscosity for amorphous semi-solid nanometer size sucrose particles as a function of T and RH are reported. Viscosity is measured by inducing coagulation between two particles and probing the thermodynamic states that induce the particle to relax into a sphere. It is shown that the glass transition temperature can be obtained by extrapolation to 1012 Pa s from the measured temperature-dependent viscosity in the 106 to 107 Pa s range. The experimental methodology was refined to allow isothermal probing of RH dependence and to increase the range of temperatures over which the dry temperature dependence can be studied. Several experiments where one monomer was sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS){,} which remains solid at high RH{,} are also reported. These sucrose–SDS dimers were observed to relax into a sphere at T and RH similar to those observed in sucrose–sucrose dimers{,} suggesting that amorphous sucrose will flow over an insoluble particle at a viscosity similar to that characteristic of coalescence between two sucrose particles. Possible physical and analytical implications of this observation are considered. The data reported here suggest that semi-solid viscosity between 104 and 1012 Pa s can be modelled over a wide range of T and RH using an adapted Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann equation and the Gordon–Taylor mixing rule. Sensitivity of modelled viscosity to variations in dry glass transition temperature{,} Gordon–Taylor constant{,} and aerosol hygroscopicity are explored{,} along with implications for atmospheric processes such as ice nucleation of glassy organic aerosols in the upper free troposphere. The reported measurement and modelling framework provides a template for characterizing the phase diagram of other amorphous aerosol systems{,} including secondary organic aerosols."

	abstract = {Organic aerosols can exist in highly viscous or glassy phase states. A viscosity database for organic compounds with atmospherically relevant functional groups is compiled and analyzed to quantify the influence of number and location of functional groups on viscosity. For weakly functionalized compounds the trend in viscosity sensitivity to functional group addition is carboxylic acid (COOH) ≈ hydroxyl (OH) > nitrate (ONO2) > carbonyl (CO) ≈ ester (COO) > methylene (CH2). Sensitivities to group addition increase with greater levels of prior functionalization and decreasing temperature. For carboxylic acids a sharp increase in sensitivity is likely present already at the second addition at room temperature. Ring structures increase viscosity relative to linear structures. Sensitivities are correlated with analogously derived sensitivities of vapor pressure reduction. This may be exploited in the future to predict viscosity in numerical models by piggybacking on schemes that track the evolution of organic aerosol volatility with age.},

	ABSTRACT = {During the CalWater 2015 field campaign, ground-level observations of aerosol size, concentration, chemical composition, and cloud activity were made at Bodega Bay, CA, on the remote California coast. A strong anthropogenic influence on air quality, aerosol physicochemical properties, and cloud activity was observed at Bodega Bay during periods with special weather conditions, known as Petaluma Gap flow, in which air from California's interior is transported to the coast. This study applies a diverse set of chemical, cloud microphysical, and meteorological measurements to the Petaluma Gap flow phenomenon for the first time. It is demonstrated that the sudden and often dramatic change in aerosol properties is strongly related to regional meteorology and anthropogenically influenced chemical processes in California's Central Valley. In addition, it is demonstrated that the change in air mass properties from those typical of a remote marine environment to properties of a continental regime has the potential to impact atmospheric radiative balance and cloud formation in ways that must be accounted for in regional climate simulations.},

	ABSTRACT = {Glycerol and propylene glycol mixtures are common carrier solutions in electronic cigarettes. Aerosols produced from these mixtures will evaporate quickly in a dry environment due to their high volatility. In a humid environment, such as the lungs, the kinetics of evaporation and hygroscopic growth determine the evolution of aerosol plume glycerol. Here, we apply a temperature and relative humidity-controlled hygroscopicity/volatility tandem differential mobility analyzer system to study the growth and evaporation kinetics of glycerol aerosol over a wide range of temperature, relative humidity, and residence times. Results show that at dry conditions glycerol aerosols evaporate within seconds at temperatures warmer than 20°C and that the accommodation coefficient of glycerol vapor on dry glycerol particles is 0.8. Under humidified conditions, the mutual depression of vapor pressures of the aqueous glycerol/water solution slows the glycerol evaporation rate consistent with thermodynamic and kinetic model predictions. Model calculations show that water vapor aided condensation of glycerol can occur at high relative humidity for glycerol vapor concentrations that result in glycerol particle evaporation under dry conditions. The combined results will help with constraining computational modules that model the evolution of glycerol-containing aerosols along a prescribed thermodynamic trajectory.}

	abstract = {Abstract Knowledge of the physical characteristics and chemical composition of marine organic aerosols is needed for the quantification of their effects on cloud microphysical processes and solar radiative transfer. Here we use xanthan gum (XG)—a bacterial biopolymer—as a proxy for marine hydrogels. Measurements were performed for pure XG particles and mixtures of XG with sodium chloride, calcium nitrate, and calcium carbonate. The aerosol hygroscopicity parameter (κ) is derived from hygroscopic growth factor measurements (κgf) at variable water activity (aw) and from cloud condensation nuclei activation efficiency (κccn). The Zdanovskii, Stokes, and Robinson (ZSR) hygroscopicity parameter derived for multicomponent systems (κmix, sol) is used to compare measurements of κgf and κccn. Pure XG shows close agreement of κgf (at aw = 0.9) and κccn of 0.09 and 0.10, respectively. Adding salts to the system results in deviations of κgf (at aw = 0.9) from κccn. The measured κgf and ZSR-derived hygroscopicity parameter (κmix, sol) values for different solutions show close agreement at aw > 0.9, while κgf is lower in comparison to κmix, sol at aw < 0.9. The differences between predicted κmix, sol and measured κgf and κccn values are explained by the effects of hydration and presence of salt ions on the structure of the polymer networks. Results from this study imply that at supersaturations of 0.1 and 0.5\%, the presence of 30\% sea salt by mass can reduce the activation diameter of pure primary marine organic aerosols from 257 to 156 nm and from 87 to 53 nm, respectively.},

	ABSTRACT = {Viscosity of atmospheric aerosol spans at least 15 orders of magnitude, from thin liquids to glassy solids, with possible concomitant impact on multiple processes of meteorological and/or climatological concern. Recently there has been interest in aerosol phase assessment techniques based upon dimer coalescence. Theoretical treatment suggests discernible reductions in dimer diameter begin when viscosity ∼108 Pa·s and the dimer is spherical at ∼105 Pa·s for submicron particles, or the middle range of the semisolid regime. A method using nanoparticle dimers synthesized by utilizing differential mobility analyzers of opposite polarity to produce monomers of opposite charge that subsequently undergo electrostatically mediated coagulation has been developed and is detailed in this work. This method was used to assess the aerosol phase state of several atmospherically relevant organic species and inorganic salts at relative humidity (RH) values ranging between 10% and 100%. Ammonium sulfate, monosodium α-ketoglutaric acid, sodium chloride, and sucrose all displayed RH-dependent phase state. These observed viscous transitions occurred at RH values less than existing deliquescence RH data, a result consistent with existing literature reports of RH-induced structural rearrangements. Fully coalesced and fully uncoalesced diameters could be fitted to single values, indicating that the presented technique is absolute. The method was also used to assess the phase state of dry sucrose aerosol at temperatures between 20°C and 70°C. A phase transition was noted at 63.7°C ± 4.4°C, near the glass transition temperature, suggesting the presented method may also be useful for probing phase responses to temperature perturbations.}

We present a novel method to measure the mass-based hygroscopicity of particles while characterizing their elemental and carbon functional group compositions. Since mass-based hygroscopicity is insensitive to particle geometry, it is advantageous for probing the hygroscopic behavior of atmospheric particles, which can have irregular morphologies. Combining scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM/EDX), scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) analysis, and in situ STXM humidification experiments, this method was validated using laboratory-generated, atmospherically relevant particles. Then, the hygroscopicity and elemental composition of 15 complex atmospheric particles were analyzed by leveraging quantification of C, N, and O from STXM, and complementary elemental quantification from SEM/EDX. We found three types of hygroscopic responses, and correlated high hygroscopicity with Na and Cl content. The mixing state of 158 other particles from the sample broadly agreed with those of the humidified particles, indicating the potential to infer atmospheric hygroscopic behavior from a selected subset of particles. These methods offer unique quantitative capabilities to characterize and correlate the hygroscopicity and chemistry of individual submicrometer atmospheric particles.}

Nine binary systems were tested combining strong ionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and nonionic surfactants (Zonyl FS-300 and Triton X-100) with nonsurfactant compounds (glucose, ammonium sulfate, or sodium chloride). Control tests were performed for systems combining organic (glucose) and inorganic compounds (ammonium sulfate or sodium chloride). Results show that CCN activity deviates strongly relative to predictions made from measurements of bulk surface tension. Köhler theory accounting for surface tension reduction and surface partitioning underpredicts the CCN activity of particles containing Zonyl FS-300 and Triton X-100. Partitioning theory better describes data for Zonyl FS-300 and Triton X-100 when limiting surface adsorption to 1.5 monolayers of the growing drop. Deviations from predictions were observed. Likely explanations include solute-solute interactions and nonspherical particle shape. The findings presented here examine in detail the perturbation of CCN activity by surfactants and may offer insight into both the success and limitations of physical models describing CCN activity of surface active molecules.},

	ABSTRACT = {A wealth of recent laboratory and field experiments demonstrate that organic aerosol composition evolves with time in the atmosphere, leading to changes in the influence of the organic fraction to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra. There is a need for tools that can realistically represent the evolution of CCN activity to better predict indirect effects of organic aerosol on clouds and climate. This work describes a model to predict the CCN activity of organic compounds from functional group composition. Following previous methods in the literature, we test the ability of semi-empirical group contribution methods in Köhler theory to predict the effective hygroscopicity parameter, kappa. However, in our approach we also account for liquid–liquid phase boundaries to simulate phase-limited activation behavior. Model evaluation against a selected database of published laboratory measurements demonstrates that kappa can be predicted within a factor of 2. Simulation of homologous series is used to identify the relative effectiveness of different functional groups in increasing the CCN activity of weakly functionalized organic compounds. Hydroxyl, carboxyl, aldehyde, hydroperoxide, carbonyl, and ether moieties promote CCN activity while methylene and nitrate moieties inhibit CCN activity. The model can be incorporated into scale-bridging test beds such as the Generator of Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A) to evaluate the evolution of kappa for a complex mix of organic compounds and to develop suitable parameterizations of CCN evolution for larger-scale models.},

	ABSTRACT = {Immersion freezing is the most relevant heterogeneous ice nucleation mechanism through which ice crystals are formed in mixed-phase clouds. In recent years, an increasing number of laboratory experiments utilizing a variety of instruments have examined immersion freezing activity of atmospherically relevant ice-nucleating particles. However, an intercomparison of these laboratory results is a difficult task because investigators have used different ice nucleation (IN) measurement methods to produce these results. A remaining challenge is to explore the sensitivity and accuracy of these techniques and to understand how the IN results are potentially influenced or biased by experimental parameters associated with these techniques. Within the framework of INUIT (Ice Nuclei Research Unit), we distributed an illite-rich sample (illite NX) as a representative surrogate for atmospheric mineral dust particles to investigators to perform immersion freezing experiments using different IN measurement methods and to obtain IN data as a function of particle concentration, temperature (T), cooling rate and nucleation time. A total of 17 measurement methods were involved in the data intercomparison. Experiments with seven instruments started with the test sample pre-suspended in water before cooling, while 10 other instruments employed water vapor condensation onto dry-dispersed particles followed by immersion freezing. The resulting comprehensive immersion freezing data set was evaluated using the ice nucleation active surface-site density, ns, to develop a representative ns(T) spectrum that spans a wide temperature range (−37 °C < T < −11 °C) and covers 9 orders of magnitude in ns. In general, the 17 immersion freezing measurement techniques deviate, within a range of about 8 °C in terms of temperature, by 3 orders of magnitude with respect to ns. In addition, we show evidence that the immersion freezing efficiency expressed in ns of illite NX particles is relatively independent of droplet size, particle mass in suspension, particle size and cooling rate during freezing. A strong temperature dependence and weak time and size dependence of the immersion freezing efficiency of illite-rich clay mineral particles enabled the ns parameterization solely as a function of temperature. We also characterized the ns(T) spectra and identified a section with a steep slope between −20 and −27 °C, where a large fraction of active sites of our test dust may trigger immersion freezing. This slope was followed by a region with a gentler slope at temperatures below −27 °C. While the agreement between different instruments was reasonable below ~ −27 °C, there seemed to be a different trend in the temperature-dependent ice nucleation activity from the suspension and dry-dispersed particle measurements for this mineral dust, in particular at higher temperatures. For instance, the ice nucleation activity expressed in ns was smaller for the average of the wet suspended samples and higher for the average of the dry-dispersed aerosol samples between about −27 and −18 °C. Only instruments making measurements with wet suspended samples were able to measure ice nucleation above −18 °C. A possible explanation for the deviation between −27 and −18 °C is discussed. Multiple exponential distribution fits in both linear and log space for both specific surface area-based ns(T) and geometric surface area-based ns(T) are provided. These new fits, constrained by using identical reference samples, will help to compare IN measurement methods that are not included in the present study and IN data from future IN instruments.},

The parameterization developed follows the form of one suggested previously for atmospheric particles of non-specific composition in quantifying ice nucleating particle concentrations as functions of temperature and the total number concentration of particles larger than 0.5 μm diameter. Such an approach does not explicitly account for surface area and time dependencies for ice nucleation, but sufficiently encapsulates the activation properties for potential use in regional and global modeling simulations, and possible application in developing remote sensing retrievals for ice nucleating particles. A calibration factor is introduced to account for the apparent underestimate (by approximately 3, on average) of the immersion freezing fraction of mineral dust particles for CSU CFDC data processed at an RHw of 105% vs. maximum fractions active at higher RHw. Instrumental factors that affect activation behavior vs. RHw in CFDC instruments remain to be fully explored in future studies. Nevertheless, the use of this calibration factor is supported by comparison to ice activation data obtained for the same aerosols from Aerosol Interactions and Dynamics of the Atmosphere (AIDA) expansion chamber cloud parcel experiments. Further comparison of the new parameterization, including calibration correction, to predictions of the immersion freezing surface active site density parameterization for mineral dust particles, developed separately from AIDA experimental data alone, shows excellent agreement for data collected in a descent through a Saharan aerosol layer. These studies support the utility of laboratory measurements to obtain atmospherically relevant data on the ice nucleation properties of dust and other particle types, and suggest the suitability of considering all mineral dust as a single type of ice nucleating particle as a useful first-order approximation in numerical modeling investigations.},

	abstract = {Ice nucleating particles (INP) are particles that play a critical role in the formation of mixed phase clouds. The INP initiate glaciation which disturbs the colloidal equilibrium of the suspended supercooled drops and, in turn, results in precipitation (Pruppacher and Klett 1996). Ice crystals are frequently observed at temperatures warmer than −15°C (Murray et al. 2012) and biologically-derived particles are a plausible source of INP in this temperature regime (Möhler et al. 2007; Prenni et al. 2009). Biological particles have been identified in cloud ice-crystal residues (Pratt et al. 2009), rain and snow (Christner et al. 2008), and ground-level air surrounding rain (Huffman et al. 2013; Prenni et al. 2013). Nonetheless, the role of biological ice nuclei in cloud glaciation remains elusive because direct links between emission and cloud ingestion processes have not been identified. Here we present observations from case studies that suggest that the active release of biological INP is causally coordinated with the arrival of a cold-frontal boundary, which lofts the nuclei to seed the frontal cloud band.}

	abstract = {Organic aerosols in the atmosphere are composed of a wide variety of species, reflecting the multitude of sources and growth processes of these particles. Especially challenging is predicting how these particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Previous studies have characterized the CCN efficiency for organic compounds in terms of a hygroscopicity parameter, κ. Here we extend these studies by systematically testing the influence of the number and location of molecular functional groups on the hygroscopicity of organic aerosols. Organic compounds synthesized via gas-phase and liquid-phase reactions were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with scanning flow CCN analysis and thermal desorption particle beam mass spectrometry. These experiments quantified changes in κ with the addition of one or more functional groups to otherwise similar molecules. The increase in κ per group decreased in the following order: hydroxyl ≫ carboxyl > hydroperoxide > nitrate ≫ methylene (where nitrate and methylene produced negative effects, and hydroperoxide and nitrate groups produced the smallest absolute effects). Our results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of chemical aging and will help guide input and parametrization choices in models relying on simplified treatments such as the atomic oxygen:carbon ratio to predict the evolution of organic aerosol hygroscopicity.}

Comparison of the model output with measurements from a research site in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado revealed that the fraction of organics in the model is underpredicted. This is most likely due to missing processes in the aerosol module in the model version used, such as new particle formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols. When boundary conditions and domain-wide initial conditions of aerosol loading are changed in the model (factors of 0.1, 0.2, and 10 of initial aerosol mass of SO4−2, NH4+, and NO3−), the domain-wide precipitation changes by about 5\%. Analysis of the model results reveals that the Rocky Mountain region and Front Range environment is not conducive for convective invigoration to play a major role, in increasing precipitation, as seen in some other studies. When localized organic aerosol emission are increased to mimic new particle formation, the resulting increased aerosol loading leads to increases in domain-wide precipitation, opposite to what is seen in the model simulations with changed boundary and initial conditions.},

	ABSTRACT = {We present in situ measurements of particle-phase liquid water. Measurements were conducted from 3 June to 15 July 2013 during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) in the southeastern US. The region is photochemically active, humid, dominated by biogenic emissions, impacted by anthropogenic pollution, and known to contain high concentrations of organic aerosol mass. Measurements characterized mobility number size distributions of ambient atmospheric aerosols in three states: unperturbed, dry, and dry-humidified. Unperturbed measurements describe the aerosol distribution at ambient temperature and relative humidity. For the dry state, the sample was routed through a cold trap upstream of the inlet then reheated, while for the dry-humidified state the sample was rehumidified after drying. The total volume of water and semi-volatile compounds lost during drying was quantified by differencing dry and unperturbed volumes from the integrated size spectra, while semi-volatile volumes lost during drying were quantified differencing unperturbed and dry-humidified volumes. Results indicate that particle-phase liquid water was always present. Throughout the SOAS campaign, median water mass concentrations at the relative humidity (RH) encountered in the instrument typically ranged from 1 to 5 μg m−3 but were as high as 73 μg m−3. On non-raining days, morning time (06:00–09:00) median mass concentrations exceeded 15 μg m−3. Hygroscopic growth factors followed a diel cycle and exceed 2 from 07:00 to 09:00 local time. The hygroscopicity parameter kappa ranged from 0.14 to 0.46 and hygroscopicity increased with increasing particle size. An observed diel cycle in kappa is consistent with changes in aerosol inorganic content and a dependency of the hygroscopicity parameter on water content. Unperturbed and dry-humidified aerosol volumes did not result in statistically discernible differences, demonstrating that drying did not lead to large losses in dry particle volume. We anticipate that our results will help improve the representation of aerosol water content and aqueous-phase-mediated partitioning of atmospheric water-soluble gases in photochemical models.},

	ABSTRACT = {Relationships between critical supersaturation required for activation and particle dry diameter have been the primary means for experimentally characterizing cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity; however, use of the dry diameter inherently limits the application to cases where the dry diameter can be used to accurately estimate solute volume. This study challenges the requirement and proposes a new experimental approach, Wet CCN, for studying CCN activity without the need for a drying step. The new approach directly measures the subsaturated portion of the Köhler curves. The experimental setup consists of a humidity-controlled differential mobility analyzer and a CCN counter; wet diameter equilibrated at known relative humidity is used to characterize CCN activity instead of the dry diameter. The experimental approach was validated against ammonium sulfate, glucose, and nonspherical ammonium oxalate monohydrate. Further, the approach was applied to a mixture of nonspherical iodine oxide particles. The Wet CCN approach successfully determined the hygroscopicity of nonspherical particles by collapsing them into spherical, deliquesced droplets. We further show that the Wet CCN approach offers unique insights into the physical and chemical impacts of the aqueous phase on CCN activity; a potential application is to investigate the impact of evaporation/co-condensation of water-soluble semivolatile species on CCN activity.},

	ABSTRACT = {Recent studies have suggested that the ice-nucleating ability of some types of pollen is derived from non-proteinaceous macromolecules. These macromolecules may become dispersed by the rupturing of the pollen grain during wetting and drying cycles in the atmosphere. If true, this mechanism might prove to be a significant source of ice nuclei (IN) concentrations when pollen is present. Here we test this hypothesis by measuring ambient IN concentrations from the beginning to the end of the 2013 pollen season in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Air samples were collected using a swirling aerosol collector twice per week and the solutions were analysed for ice nuclei activity using a droplet freezing assay. Rainwater samples were collected at times when pollen grain number concentrations were near their maximum value and analysed with the drop-freezing assay to compare the potentially enhanced IN concentrations measured near the ground with IN concentrations found aloft. Ambient ice nuclei spectra, defined as the number of ice nuclei per volume of air as a function of temperature, are inferred from the aerosol collector solutions. No general trend was observed between ambient pollen grain counts and observed IN concentrations, suggesting that ice nuclei multiplication via pollen grain rupturing and subsequent release of macromolecules was not prevalent for the pollen types and meteorological conditions typically encountered in the southeastern US. A serendipitously sampled collection after a downpour provided evidence for a rain-induced IN burst with an observed IN concentration of approximately 30 per litre, a 30-fold increase over background concentrations at −20 °C. The onset temperature of freezing for these particles was approximately −12 °C, suggesting that the ice-nucleating particles were biological in origin.},

	abstract = {Aerosol water content plays an important role in aqueous phase reactions, in controlling visibility, and in cloud formation processes. One way to quantify aerosol water content is to measure hygroscopic growth using the hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) technique. However, the HTDMA technique becomes less reliable at relative humidity (RH) >90% due to the difficulty of controlling temperature and RH inside the second DMA. For this study, we have designed and implemented a new HTDMA system with improved temperature and RH control. Temperature stability in the second DMA was achieved to ±0.02°C tolerance by implementing active control using thermoelectric heat exchangers and PID control loops. The DMA size resolution was increased by operating high-flow DMA columns at a sheath:sample flow ratio of 15:0.5. This improved size resolution allowed for improving the accuracy of the RH sensors by interspersing ammonium sulfate reference scans at high frequency. We present growth factor data for pure compounds at RH up to 99% and compare the data to theoretical values and to available bulk water activity data. With this HTDMA instrument and method, the osmotic coefficients of spherical, nonvolatile aerosols of known composition between 30 and 200 nm in diameter can be determined within ±20%. We expect that data from this instrument will lead to an improvement of aerosol water content models by contributing to the understanding of aerosol water uptake at high RH.},

	abstract = {A small fraction of particles in the atmosphere can catalyze ice formation in cloud water drops through heterogeneous freezing nucleation at temperatures warmer than the homogeneous freezing temperature of approximately −38°C. The rate for heterogeneous freezing nucleation is dependent on several factors, including the type and surface area of dust that is immersed inside the drop. Although nucleation is an inherently stochastic process resulting from size fluctuations of the incipient ice germ, there is a growing body of literature that suggests that quasi-deterministic models of ice nucleation can describe laboratory experiments. Here we present new experiments and simulations that aim to better constrain theoretical models fitted to laboratory data. We collected ice nucleation data for Arizona Test Dust aerosol immersed in water using a droplet freezing assay setup that allows for the cooling rates to be changed between 10 and 0.01 K min−1. Discrete event simulations based on a variant of the multiple-component stochastic model of heterogeneous freezing nucleation were used to simulate different experimental procedures. The nucleation properties of the dust are specified by four material-dependent parameters that accurately describe the time dependence of the freezing process. We anticipate that the combination of discrete event simulations and a spectrum of experimental procedures described here can be used to design more meaningful laboratory experiments probing ice nucleation and will aid the development of better parameterizations for use in models.},

The presence of surface active compounds in the particle may affect the critical supersaturation that is required to activate a particle.

In this study, we introduce a hybrid model that accounts for partitioning between the bulk and surface phases in the context of single parameter representations of cloud condensation nucleus activity. The presented formulation incorporates analytical approximations of surfactant partitioning to yield a set of equations that maintain the conceptual and mathematical simplicity of the single parameter framework. The resulting set of equations allows users of the single parameter model to account for surfactant partitioning by applying minor modifications to already existing code.},

For compounds with a weak dependence of water activity on temperature, the critical supersaturation of the particles can be well-modeled using temperature-dependent surface tension and Köhler theory. We also demonstrate that Köhler theory is valid for sparingly soluble compounds and can quantitatively explain the temperature-dependent activation properties of adipic acid aerosol over a broad range of temperatures. Accounting for temperature-dependent surface tension strongly affects CCN activity, and we anticipate that including this effect in global and regional model simulations may significantly change the estimated aerosol indirect forcing.}

	abstract = {Secondary organic compounds are an important component of ambient aerosol and potentially lower the supersaturation that is required for individual particles to serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formed from the oxidation of a single precursor can be composed of many different compounds and their overall CCN efficiency has been reported for many different SOA systems. An aerosol's CCN efficiency can be described by a single hygroscopicity parameter, κ. However, this κ comprises an unknown distribution of underlying κ-values resulting from each individual compound in the SOA mixture. Here we report on a new technique for characterizing this distribution ofκ. Precursor hydrocarbons were oxidized in an environmental chamber to form SOA, which was collected on filters and extracted using ethyl acetate. Extracts were then fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using gradient elution with acetonitrile and water. The eluate was atomized, the solvent was removed by evaporation, and the residual aerosol particles were analyzed as a function of retention time using scanning flow CCN analysis. Kappa-values generally decreased with component retention time, consistent with expected decreasing polarity. Averaged SOAκ-values reconstructed by integrating over the chromatogram agreed well with values measured for SOA sampled directly from the environmental chamber, suggesting thatκfor SOA represents the volume-weighted average of the constituent compounds'κ-values. We anticipate that our measured hygroscopicity distributions will serve as validation points for mechanistic models that seek to predict the generation and evolution of organic aerosol composition and properties in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The ability of particles composed wholly or partially of biogenic secondary organic compounds to serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is a key characteristic that helps to define their roles in linking biogeochemical and water cycles. In this paper, we describe size-resolved (14–350 nm) CCN measurements from the Manitou Experimental Forest in Colorado, where particle compositions were expected to have a large biogenic component. These measurements were conducted for 1 year as part of the Bio-hydro-atmosphere Interactions of Energy, Aerosols, Carbon, H2O, Organics, and Nitrogen program and determined the aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, κ, at five water supersaturations between ∼0.14\% and ∼0.97\%. The average κ value over the entire study and all supersaturations was κavg = 0.16 ± 0.08. Kappa values decreased slightly with increasing supersaturation, suggesting a change in aerosol composition with dry diameter. Furthermore, some seasonal variability was observed with increased CCN concentrations and activated particle number fraction, but slightly decreased hygroscopicity, during the summer. Small particle events, which may indicate new particle formation, were observed throughout the study period, especially in the summer, leading to increases in CCN concentration, followed by a gradual increase in the aerosol mode size. The condensing material appeared to be predominantly composed of organic compounds and led to a small decrease in κ at the larger activation diameters during and immediately after those events.},

	abstract = "Understanding cloud and precipitation responses to variations in atmospheric aerosols remains an important research topic for improving the prediction of climate. Knowledge is most uncertain, and the potential impact on climate is largest with regard to how aerosols impact ice formation in clouds. In this paper, we show that research on atmospheric ice nucleation, including the development of new measurement systems, is occurring at a renewed and historically unparalleled level. A historical perspective is provided on the methods and challenges of measuring ice nuclei, and the various factors that led to a lull in research efforts during a nearly 20-yr period centered about 30 yr ago. Workshops played a major role in defining critical needs for improving measurements at that time and helped to guide renewed efforts. Workshops were recently revived for evaluating present research progress. We argue that encouraging progress has been made in the consistency of measurements using the present generation of ice nucleation instruments. Through comparison to laboratory cloud simulations, these ice nuclei measurements have provided increased confidence in our ability to quantify primary ice formation by atmospheric aerosols."

	ABSTRACT = {The ability of coated mineral dust particles to act as ice nuclei (IN) was investigated at LACIS (Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator) during the FROST1- and FROST2-campaigns (Freezing of dust). Sulphuric acid was condensed on the particles which afterwards were optionally humidified, treated with ammonia vapour and/or heat. By means of aerosol mass spectrometry we found evidence that processing of mineral dust particles with sulphuric acid leads to surface modifications of the particles. These surface modifications are most likely responsible for the observed reduction of the IN activation of the particles. The observed particle mass spectra suggest that different treatments lead to different chemical reactions on the particle surface. Possible chemical reaction pathways and products are suggested and the implications on the IN efficiency of the treated dust particles are discussed.},

	ABSTRACT = {Black carbon (BC) is a short term climate forcer that directly warms the atmosphere, slows convection, and hinders quantification of the effect of greenhouse gases on climate change. The atmospheric lifetime of BC particles with respect to nucleation scavenging in clouds is controlled by their ability to serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). To serve as CCN under typical conditions, hydrophobic BC particles must acquire hygroscopic coatings. However, the quantitative relationship between coatings and hygroscopic properties for ambient BC particles is not known nor is the time scale for hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic conversion. Here we introduce a method for measuring the hygroscopicity of externally and internally mixed BC particles by coupling a single particle soot photometer with a humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer. We test this technique using uncoated and coated laboratory generated model BC compounds and apply it to characterize the hygroscopicity distribution of ambient BC particles. From these data we derive that the observed number fraction of BC that is CCN active at 0.2 % supersaturation is generally low in an urban area near sources and that it varies with the trajectory of the airmass. We anticipate that our method can be combined with measures of air parcel physical and photochemical age to provide the first quantitative estimates for characterizing hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic conversion rates in the atmosphere.},

Methods exist with which the fractions of organic aerosol resulting directly from anthropogenic and biogenic processes can be estimated. However, anthropogenic emissions can also lead to an enhancement in secondary organic aerosol formation from naturally emitted precursors. We term this enhanced biogenic secondary organic aerosol (eBSOA). Here, we review the mechanisms through which such an effect may occur in the atmosphere and describe a work flow via which it may be quantified, using existing measurement techniques. An examination of published data reveals support for the existence of the enhancement effect.},

	ABSTRACT = {Dust particles represent a dominant source of particulate matter (by mass) to the atmosphere, and their emission from some source regions has been shown to be transported on regional and hemispherical scales. Dust particles' potential to interact with water vapor in the atmosphere can lead to important radiative impacts on the climate system, both direct and indirect. We have investigated this interaction for several types of dust aerosol, collected from the Southwestern United States and the Saharan region. A continuous flow diffusion chamber was operated to measure the ice nucleation ability of the dust particles in the temperature range of relevance to cirrus and mixed-phase clouds (−65<T<−20 °C). In most experiments, particles were size selected using a differential mobility analyzer prior to sampling to give information on heterogeneity of the sample with size, generally in the range of diameters 100–400 nm. All dust nucleated ice heterogeneously in the deposition mode colder than about −40 °C, but required droplet activation in the exclusively heterogeneous ice nucleation regime warmer than −36 °C. Ice nucleated on 1% of dry generated dust particles of a given type at a similar relative humidity with respect to ice irrespective of temperature between −60 and −40 °C, however differences in relative humidity for ice nucleation was observed between the different dust types. The Saharan dust types exhibited a dependency on particle size below 500 nm. Additional data were collected during the International Workshop on Comparing Ice Nucleation Measurement Systems (ICIS, 2007) which indicated that ice nucleation on larger, polydisperse dust particles occurs at warmer temperatures than found for the smaller particles. When particles were coated with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) species, higher relative humidity was required for ice nucleation below −40 °C, similar to that required for homogeneous nucleation of sulfates. However, ice nucleation was still observed on SOA-coated dust at warmer temperatures than are required for homogeneous nucleation of sulfates, indicating that condensation freezing occurs without any apparent deactivation for temperatures between −25 and −35 °C.},

	ABSTRACT = {During the FROST-2 (FReezing Of duST) measurement campaign conducted at the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS), we investigated changes in the ice nucleation properties of 300 nm Arizona Test Dust mineral particles following thermochemical processing by varying amounts and combinations of exposure to sulphuric acid vapour, ammonia gas, water vapour, and heat. The processed particles' heterogeneous ice nucleation properties were determined in both the water subsaturated and supersaturated humidity regimes at −30 °C and −25 °C using Colorado State University's continuous flow diffusion chamber. The amount of sulphuric acid coating material was estimated by an aerosol mass spectrometer and from CCN-derived hygroscopicity measurements. The condensation of sulphuric acid decreased the dust particles' ice nucleation ability in proportion to the amount of sulphuric acid added. Heating the coated particles in a thermodenuder at 250 °C – intended to evaporate the sulphuric acid coating – reduced their freezing ability even further. We attribute this behaviour to accelerated acid digestion of ice active surface sites by heat. Exposing sulphuric acid coated dust to ammonia gas produced particles with similarly poor freezing potential; however a portion of their ice nucleation ability could be restored after heating in the thermodenuder. In no case did any combination of thermochemical treatments increase the ice nucleation ability of the coated mineral dust particles compared to unprocessed dust. These first measurements of the effect of identical chemical processing of dust particles on their ice nucleation ability under both water subsaturated and mixed-phase supersaturated cloud conditions revealed that ice nucleation was more sensitive to all coating treatments in the water subsaturated regime. The results clearly indicate irreversible impairment of ice nucleation activity in both regimes after condensation of concentrated sulphuric acid. This implies that the sulphuric acid coating caused permanent chemical and/or physical modification of the ice active surface sites; the possible dissolution of the coating during droplet activation did not restore all immersion/condensation-freezing ability.},

	abstract = {The Amazon Basin provides an excellent environment for studying the sources, transformations, and properties of natural aerosol particles and the resulting links between biological processes and climate. With this framework in mind, the Amazonian Aerosol Characterization Experiment (AMAZE-08), carried out from 7 February to 14 March 2008 during the wet season in the central Amazon Basin, sought to understand the formation, transformations, and cloud-forming properties of fine- and coarse-mode biogenic aerosol particles, especially as related to their effects on cloud activation and regional climate. Special foci included (1) the production mechanisms of secondary organic components at a pristine continental site, including the factors regulating their temporal variability, and (2) predicting and understanding the cloud-forming properties of biogenic particles at such a site. In this overview paper, the field site and the instrumentation employed during the campaign are introduced. Observations and findings are reported, including the large-scale context for the campaign, especially as provided by satellite observations. New findings presented include: (i) a particle number-diameter distribution from 10 nm to 10 μm that is representative of the pristine tropical rain forest and recommended for model use; (ii) the absence of substantial quantities of primary biological particles in the submicron mode as evidenced by mass spectral characterization; (iii) the large-scale production of secondary organic material; (iv) insights into the chemical and physical properties of the particles as revealed by thermodenuder-induced changes in the particle number-diameter distributions and mass spectra; and (v) comparisons of ground-based predictions and satellite-based observations of hydrometeor phase in clouds. A main finding of AMAZE-08 is the dominance of secondary organic material as particle components. The results presented here provide mechanistic insight and quantitative parameters that can serve to increase the accuracy of models of the formation, transformations, and cloud-forming properties of biogenic natural aerosol particles, especially as related to their effects on cloud activation and regional climate.},

Measurements of ice crystal number concentrations were found to be in good agreement both with measured number concentrations of ice nuclei feeding the clouds and with ice nuclei number concentrations determined from the residual nuclei of cloud particles collected by a counterflow virtual impactor. Using lognormal distributions fitted to measured aerosol size distributions and measured aerosol chemical compositions, ice nuclei and ice crystal concentrations in the wave cloud were reasonably well predicted in a 1D parcel model framework. Two different empirical parameterizations were used in the parcel model: a parameterization based on aerosol chemical type and surface area and a parameterization that links ice nuclei number concentrations to the number concentrations of particles with diameters larger than 0.5 μm. This study shows that aerosol size distribution and composition measurements can be used to constrain ice initiation by primary nucleation in models. The data and model results also suggest the likelihood that the dust particle mode of the aerosol size distribution controls the number concentrations of the heterogeneous ice nuclei, at least for the lower temperatures examined in this case.",

	abtract = {As part of the Fire Lab at Missoula Experiments (FLAME) in 2006–2007, we examined hygroscopic properties of particles emitted from open combustion of 33 select biomass fuels. Measurements of humidification growth factors for subsaturated water relative humidity (RH) conditions were made with a hygroscopic tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA) for dry particle sizes of 50, 100 and 250 nm. Results were then fit to a single-parameter model to obtain the hygroscopicity parameter, κ. Particles in freshly emitted biomass smoke exhibited a wide range of hygroscopicity (individual modes with 0<κ<1.0), spanning a range from the hygroscopicity of fresh diesel soot emissions to that of pure inorganic salts commonly found in the ambient aerosol. Smoke aerosols dominated by carbonaceous species typically had a unimodal growth factor with corresponding mean κ=0.1 (range of 0<κ<0.4). Those with a substantial inorganic mass fraction typically separated into less- and more-hygroscopic modes at high RH, the latter with mean κ=0.4 (range of 0.1<κ<1). The bimodal κ distributions were indicative of smoke chemical heterogeneity at a single particle size, whereas heterogeneity as a function of size was indicated by typically decreasing κ values with increasing dry particle diameters. Hygroscopicity varied strongly with biomass fuel type and, to a lesser extent, with combustion conditions. Among the most hygroscopic smokes were those from palmetto, rice straw, and sawgrass, while smoke particles from coniferous species such as spruces, firs, pines, and duffs were among the least hygroscopic. Overall, hygroscopicity decreased with increasing ratios of total carbon to inorganic ions as measured in PM2.5 filter samples. Despite aerosol heterogeneity, reconstructions of κ using PM2.5 bulk chemical composition data fell along a 1:1 line with measured ensemble κ values.},

Comparisons are made among critical supersaturation values from the CCN instruments and derived from measurements made with a humidified tandem differential mobility system. The comparison is quite encouraging: with few exceptions the reported critical supersaturations agree within known experimental uncertainty limits. Also reported are CCN- and hygroscopicity-based estimates of the soot particles' solute fraction. Relative differences between these are as large as 40\%, but an error analysis demonstrates that agreement within experimental uncertainty is achieved. We also analyze data from the Droplet Measurement Technologies and the two Wyoming static diffusion instruments for evidence of size distribution broadening and investigate levoglucosan particle growth kinetics in the Wyoming CCN instrument.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of cloud and precipitation formation processes remains incomplete, yet global precipitation is predominantly produced by clouds containing the ice phase. Ice first forms in clouds warmer than -36~{\textdegree}C on particles termed ice nuclei. We combine observations from field studies over a 14-year period, from a variety of locations around the globe, to show that the concentrations of ice nuclei active in mixed-phase cloud conditions can be related to temperature and the number concentrations of particles larger than 0.5~μm in diameter. This new relationship reduces unexplained variability in ice nuclei concentrations at a given temperature from \~{}103 to less than a factor of 10, with the remaining variability apparently due to variations in aerosol chemical composition or other factors. When implemented in a global climate model, the new parameterization strongly alters cloud liquid and ice water distributions compared to the simple, temperature-only parameterizations currently widely used. The revised treatment indicates a global net cloud radiative forcing increase of \~{}1~W~m-2 for each order of magnitude increase in ice nuclei concentrations, demonstrating the strong sensitivity of climate simulations to assumptions regarding the initiation of cloud glaciation.},

	abstract = {The influence of varying levels of water mixing ratio, r, during the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from the ozonolysis of α-pinene on the SOA hygroscopicity and volatility was investigated. The reaction proceeded and aerosols were generated in a mixing chamber and the hygroscopic characteristics of the SOA were determined with the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS) and a Cloud Condensation Nuclei counter (CCNc). In parallel, a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) located downstream of a thermodenuder (TD) sampling from the mixing chamber, to collect mass spectra of particles from the volatile and less-volatile fractions of the SOA. Results showed that both hygroscopic growth and the volatile fraction of the SOA increased with increases in r inside the mixing chamber during SOA generation. An effective density of 1.40 g cm−3 was observed for the generated SOA when the reaction proceeded with r>1 g kg−1. Changes in the concentrations of the fragment CO2+ and the sum of CxHyOz+ (short name CHO) and CxHy+ (short name CH) fragments as measured by the HR-ToF-AMS were used to estimate changes in the oxidation level of the SOA with reaction conditions, using the ratios CO2+ to CH and CHO to CH. Under humid conditions, both ratios increased, corresponding to the presence of more oxygenated functional groups (i.e., multifunctional carboxylic acids). This result is consistent with the α-pinene ozonolysis mechanisms which suggest that water interacts with the stabilized Criegee intermediate. The volatility and the hygroscopicity results show that SOA generation via ozonolysis of α-pinene in the presence of water vapour (r<16.9 g kg−1) leads to the formation of more highly oxygenated compounds that are more hygroscopic and more volatile than compounds formed under dry conditions.},

Since it has been proposed that the rate of homogeneous freezing depends on solution water activity, we made separate measurements of the hygroscopicity (κ) of the ambient aerosol. Observed κ ranged from 0.1 to 0.2, lower than that of ammonium sulfate (0.6) and representative of a continental aerosol. As predicted for this difference in κ, there was no significant difference between the homogeneous freezing conditions of size-selected ammonium sulfate and the apparent homogeneous freezing conditions of same-sized ambient aerosol. Further, the parameterization predicted freezing fraction-relative humidity relationships for non size-selected ambient aerosol that differed by only 0.5 to 1.5\% relative humidity from observed relations at the tested temperatures, well within experimental uncertainty. Our findings confirm that the tested ambient aerosols, with hygroscopicities typical of continental regions, freeze homogeneously as expected based on present understanding for single component solution drops in the laboratory. Results also confirm that freezing is more sensitive to particle size than to composition, for particles containing at least a few percent by volume of hygroscopic species.},

We compare predictions of CCN activity using water activities based on Raoult's law and Flory-Huggins theory to observations.

Values of the hygroscopicity parameter, kappa, were derived from both hygroscopic growth measurements and size-resolved (30–300 nm in diameter) cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) measurements for smokes emitted by the open combustion of 24 biomass fuels from the United States and Asia. To analyze the complex cloud condensation nuclei response curves we propose a new inversion scheme that corrects for multiple charge effects without the necessity of prior assumptions about the chemical composition and mixing state of the particles. Kappa varied between 0.02 (weakly hygroscopic) and 0.8 (highly hygroscopic). For individual smokes, kappa was a function of particle size, with 250 nm particles being generally weakly hygroscopic and sub-100 nm particles being more hygroscopic. At any given size the emissions were often externally mixed, showing more and less hygroscopic growth modes and bimodal CCN activation spectra. Comparisons between growth factor-derived and CCN-derived hygroscopicities were consistent when taking this heterogeneity into account. A conceptual model of biomass burning emissions suggests that most particles are CCN active at the point of emission and do not require conversion in the atmosphere to more hygroscopic compositions before they can participate in cloud formation and undergo wet deposition.},

	abstract  ="Atmospheric heterogeneous reactions can potentially change the hygroscopicity of atmospheric aerosols as they undergo chemical aging processes in the atmosphere. A particle’s hygroscopicity influences its cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties with potential impacts on cloud formation and climate. In this study{,} size-selected calcite mineral particles were reacted with controlled amounts of nitric acid vapour over a wide range of relative humidities in an aerosol flow tube to study the conversion of insoluble and thus apparently non-hygroscopic calcium carbonate into soluble and hygroscopic calcium nitrate. The rate of hygroscopic change particles undergo during a heterogeneous reaction is derived from experimental measurements for the first time. The chemistry of the reacted particles was determined using an ultrafine aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UF-ATOFMS) while the particles’ hygroscopicity was determined through measuring CCN activation curves fit to a single parameter of hygroscopicity{,} κ. The reaction is rapid{,} corresponding to atmospheric timescales of hours. At low to moderate HNO3 exposures{,} the increase in the hygroscopicity of the particles is a linear function of the HNO3(g) exposure. The experimentally observed conversion rate was used to constrain a simple but accurate kinetic model. This model predicts that calcite particles will be rapidly converted into hygroscopic particles (κ > 0.1) within 4 h for low HNO3 mixing ratios (10 pptv) and in less than 3 min for 1000 pptv HNO3. This suggests that the hygroscopic conversion of the calcite component of atmospheric mineral dust aerosol will be controlled by the availability of nitric acid and similar reactants{,} and not by the atmospheric residence time."

	abstract  ="Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and ice nucleation behavior (for temperatures ≤−40 °C) of soot aerosols relevant for atmospheric studies were investigated. Soots were chosen to represent a range of physico-chemical properties{,} from hydrophobic through a range of hydrophilicity{,} to hygroscopic. These characteristics were achieved through generation by three different combustion sources; three soots from natural gas pyrolysis (original: TS; graphitized: GTS; and oxidized: TOS){,} soot from a diffusion flame in an oil lamp burning aviation kerosene (TC1){,} and soot from a turbulent diffusion flame in an aircraft engine combustor (AEC). All of the samples exhibited some heterogeneity in our experiments{,} which showed evidence of two or more particle sub-types even within a narrow size cut. The heterogeneity could have resulted from both chemical and sizing differences{,} the latter attributable in part to particle non-sphericity. Neither GTS nor TS{,} hydrophobic particles distinguished only by the lower porosity and polarity of the GTS surface{,} showed CCN activity at or below water supersaturations required for wettable{,} insoluble particles (the Kelvin limit). TC1 soot particles{,} despite classification as hydrophilic{,} did not show CCN activity at or below the Kelvin limit. We attribute this result to the microporosity of this soot. In contrast{,} oxidized{,} non-porous{,} and hydrophilic TOS particles exhibited CCN activation at very near the Kelvin limit{,} with a small percentage of these particles CCN-active even at lower supersaturations. Due to containing a range of surface coverage of organic and inorganic hydrophilic and hygroscopic compounds{,} up to ∼35% of hygroscopic AEC particles were active as CCN{,} with a small percentage of these particles CCN-active at lower supersaturations. In ice nucleation experiments below −40 °C{,} AEC particles nucleated ice near the expected condition for homogeneous freezing of water from aqueous solutions. In contrast{,} GTS{,} TS{,} and TC1 required relative humidity well in excess of water saturation at −40 °C for ice formation. GTS particles required water supersaturation conditions for ice activation even at −51 °C. At −51 to −57 °C{,} ice formation in particles with electrical mobility diameter of 200 nm occurred in up to 1 in 1000 TS and TC1 particles{,} and 1 in 100 TOS particles{,} at relative humidities below those required for homogeneous freezing in aqueous solutions. Our results suggest that heterogeneous ice nucleation is favored in cirrus conditions on oxidized hydrophilic soot of intermediate polarity. Simple considerations suggest that the impact of hydrophilic soot particles on cirrus cloud formation would be most likely in regions of elevated atmospheric soot number concentrations. The ice formation properties of AEC soot are reasonably consistent with present understanding of the conditions required for aircraft contrail formation and the proportion of soot expected to nucleate under such conditions."

These measurements are the first of their kind to investigate the role that such particles may play in ice formation in upper tropospheric clouds. Measurements of aerosol water uptake were used to examine the role of hygroscopicity in low-temperature ice nucleation by biomass combustion particles. Ice formation by the smoke particles at below −45°C and below water saturation followed the temperature and relative humidity dependencies predicted for water activity-based homogeneous freezing within measurement uncertainties. As predicted, relative humidity dependence of homogeneous freezing fractions on hygroscopicity was weak in comparison with the temperature dependence for biomass particles of typical atmospheric sizes. The action of heterogeneous ice nucleation in or on these small smoke particles in the haze particle regime could not be distinguished within measurement uncertainties. Impedance of homogeneous freezing below −50°C was inferred for freezing higher number fractions of predominantly organic smoke particles separately reported to contain an abundance of large organic molecules, consistent with the recently predicted onset conditions for and impact of viscous or glassy aerosol phase states. Finally, we note that precision and accuracy requirements of instrumentation for resolving modest impacts (a few degrees less supercooling or a few percent lower relative humidity) of heterogeneous freezing, as compared with homogeneous freezing in the upper tropospheric temperature regime present difficulties for validating aerosol impacts on cirrus.},

	abstract = {Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA) studied in previous laboratory experiments generally showed only slight hygroscopic growth, but a much better activity as a CCN (Cloud Condensation Nucleus) than indicated by the hygroscopic growth. This discrepancy was examined at LACIS (Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator), using a portable generator that produced SOA particles from the ozonolysis of α-pinene, and adding butanol or butanol and water vapor during some of the experiments. The light scattering signal of dry SOA-particles was measured by the LACIS optical particle spectrometer and was used to derive a refractive index for SOA of 1.45. LACIS also measured the hygroscopic growth of SOA particles up to 99.6% relative humidity (RH), and a CCN counter was used to measure the particle activation. SOA-particles were CCN active with critical diameters of e.g. 100 nm and 55 nm at super-saturations of 0.4% and 1.1%, respectively. But only slight hygroscopic growth with hygroscopic growth factors ≤1.05 was observed at RH<98% RH. At RH>98%, the hygroscopic growth increased stronger than would be expected if a constant hygroscopicity parameter for the particle/droplet solution was assumed. An increase of the hygroscopicity parameter by a factor of 4–6 was observed in the RH-range from below 90% to 99.6%, and this increase continued for increasingly diluted particle solutions for activating particles. This explains an observation already made in the past: that the relation between critical super-saturation and dry diameter for activation is steeper than what would be expected for a constant value of the hygroscopicity. Combining measurements of hygroscopic growth and activation, it was found that the surface tension that has to be assumed to interpret the measurements consistently is greater than 55 mN/m, possibly close to that of pure water, depending on the different SOA-types produced, and therefore only in part accounts for the discrepancy between hygroscopic growth and CCN activity observed for SOA particles in the past.},

The observed relationships are complex, suggesting highly non-ideal behavior for aerosol water contents at relative humidities less than 98%. We present two models that may explain the observed water activity-composition relationship equally well. The first model assumes that the aerosol is a pseudo binary mixture of infinitely water soluble compounds and sparingly soluble compounds that gradually enter the solution as dilution increases. The second model is used to compute the Gibbs free energy of the aerosol-water mixture and shows that the aerosol behaves similarly to what can be expected for single compounds that contain a certain fraction of oxygenated and non-polar functional groups.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric mineral dust particles can alter cloud properties and thus climate by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that form cloud droplets. The CCN activation properties of various calcium mineral dust particles were studied experimentally to investigate the consequences of field observations showing the segregation of sulphate from nitrate and chloride between individual aged Asian dust particles, and the enrichment of oxalic acid in Asian dust. Each mineral's observed apparent hygroscopicity was primarily controlled by its solubility, which determines the degree to which the mineral's intrinsic hygroscopicity can be expressed. The significant increase in hygroscopicity caused by mixing soluble hygroscopic material with insoluble mineral particles is also presented. Insoluble minerals including calcium carbonate, representing fresh unprocessed dust, and calcium sulphate, representing atmospherically processed dust, had similarly small apparent hygroscopicities. Their activation is accurately described by a deliquescence limit following the Kelvin effect and corresponded to an apparent single-hygroscopicity parameter, κ, of ~0.001. Soluble calcium chloride and calcium nitrate, representing atmospherically processed mineral dust particles, were much more hygroscopic, activating similar to ammonium sulphate with κ~0.5. Calcium oxalate monohydrate (κ=0.05) was significantly less CCN-active than oxalic acid (κ=0.3), but not as inactive as its low solubility would predict. These results indicate that the common assumption that all mineral dust particles become more hygroscopic and CCN-active after atmospheric processing should be revisited. Calcium sulphate and calcium oxalate are two realistic proxies for aged mineral dust that remain non-hygroscopic. The dust's apparent hygroscopicity will be controlled by its chemical mixing state, which is determined by its mineralogy and the chemical reaction pathways it experiences during transport.},

	abstract = {Hygroscopicity and cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) activity were measured for three mineral dust samples: one from the Canary Islands, representing North African dust transported across the Atlantic; one from outside Cairo, representing North African dust transported to the eastern Mediterranean; and Arizona Test Dust, representing dust in the southwestern United States. To reaerosolize bulk samples, dust samples were either suspended in high purity water and particles generated by atomization, or samples were resuspended in dry air using a fluidized bed. Only the Canary Island sample generated from aqueous suspension showed appreciable hygroscopic growth at subsaturated conditions; all other samples exhibited diameter growth factors of less than 1.1 for relative humidities ≤90\%. Despite their low hygroscopicities at subsaturated conditions, all samples activated as cloud droplets at supersaturations lower than required for insoluble particles. We suggest that the CCN activity of these mineral dusts are well-represented using the hygroscopicity parameter 0.01 ≤ κ ≤ 0.08.},

	abstract = {Biomass burning is a significant source of carbonaceous aerosol in many regions of the world. When present, biomass burning particles may affect the microphysical properties of clouds through their ability to function as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei. We report on measurements of the ice nucleation ability of biomass burning particles performed on laboratory-generated aerosols at the second Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment. During the experiment we generated smoke through controlled burns of 21 biomass fuels from the United States and Asia. Using a Colorado State University continuous flow diffusion chamber, we measured the condensation/immersion freezing potential at temperatures relevant to cold cumulus clouds (−30°C). Smokes from 9 of the 21 fuels acted as ice nuclei at fractions of 1:10,000 to 1:100 particles in at least one burn of each fuel; emissions from the remaining fuels were below the ice nuclei detection limit for all burns of each fuel. Using a bottom-up emission model, we estimate that smokes that emit ice nuclei fractions exceeding 1:10,000 particles can perturb ice nuclei concentrations on a regional scale.},

Ambient measurements suggest that the main particle types that function as IN are metal oxides and dust. However, carbonaceous particles often are the next most abundant IN particle type, although the source and exact chemical compositions of these particles are unknown. Here we explore the ice nucleating ability of one potential source of carbonaceous IN to the atmosphere, secondary organic aerosol (SOA). We generated SOA by ozonolysis of 25 different organic precursors in the presence of an OH scavenger. For all experiments, ice nucleation was not observed in detectable quantities. We conclude that SOA generated from ozonolysis of alkenes is an unlikely source of IN to the atmosphere.},

Usually size and hygroscopicity alone are sufficient to predict CCN activity. Single parameter representations for hygroscopicity have been shown to successfully model complex, multicomponent particles types. Under the assumption of either complete solubility, or complete insolubility of a component, it is not necessary to explicitly include that component's solubility into the single parameter framework. This is not the case if sparingly soluble materials are present. In this work we explicitly account for solubility by modifying the single parameter equations. We demonstrate that sensitivity to the actual value of solubility emerges only in the regime of 2×10−1–5×10−4, where the solubility values are expressed as volume of solute per unit volume of water present in a saturated solution. Compounds that do not fall inside this sparingly soluble envelope can be adequately modeled assuming they are either infinitely soluble in water or completely insoluble.},

Aerosol water contents are highly dependent upon aerosol hygroscopicity and ambient relative humidities (RH). In this work we evaluate a recently proposed parameterization of composition-dependent aerosol hygroscopicity that predicts the volume of liquid water associated with a unit volume of dry aerosol. The predictions over the range 10%<RH<99% are compared with those from a rigorous thermodynamic model and shown to predict water volumes within ∼20% for the high water contents (RH>85%) expected to have the most significant effects on tropospheric chemistry and radiation balance.

	abstract  ="The interaction of water with laboratory soots possessing a range of properties relevant for atmospheric studies is examined by two complementary methods: gravimetrical measurement of water uptake coupled with chemical composition and porosity analysis and HTDMA (humidified tandem differential mobility analyzer) inference of water uptake accompanied by separate TEM (transmission electron microscopy) analysis of single particles. The first method clarifies the mechanism of water uptake for bulk soot and allows the classification of soot with respect to its hygroscopicity. The second method highlights the dependence of the soot aerosol growth factor on relative humidity (RH) for quasi-monodisperse particles. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic soot are qualitatively defined by their water uptake and surface polarity: laboratory soot particles are thus classified from very hydrophobic to very hydrophilic. Thermal soot particles produced from natural gas combustion are classified as hydrophobic with a surface of low polarity since water is found to cover only half of the surface. Graphitized thermal soot particles are proposed for comparison as extremely hydrophobic and of very low surface polarity. Soot particles produced from laboratory flame of TC1 aviation kerosene are less hydrophobic{,} with their entire surface being available for statistical monolayer water coverage at RH ∼ 10%. Porosity measurements suggest that{,} initially{,} much of this surface water resides within micropores. Consequently{,} the growth factor increase of these particles to 1.07 at RH > 80% is attributed to irreversible swelling that accompanies water uptake. Hysteresis of adsorption/desorption cycles strongly supports this conclusion. In contrast{,} aircraft engine soot{,} produced from burning TC1 kerosene in a gas turbine engine combustor{,} has an extremely hydrophilic surface of high polarity. Due to the presence of water soluble organic and inorganic material it can be covered by many water layers even below water saturation conditions. This soot demonstrates a gradual diameter growth factor (Dwet/Ddry) increase up to 1.22 at 93% relative humidity{,} most likely due to the presence of single particles with water soluble material heterogeneously distributed over their surface."

Two optical particle counters are utilized, one measures the aerosol size spectrum at ambient relative humidity and the other simultaneously dries the aerosol prior to light scattering detection. Growth factors are based on measurements made in the region of the Mie scattering curve where scattered light intensity increases monotonically with dry and wet particle diameter, i.e. D<0.9 μm. Factors influencing the accuracy of the measurement are evaluated, including particle drying, refractive index and shape. Growth factors at 90±3% ambient relative humidity in marine airmasses 400 km west of San Diego, California range between 1.5 and 1.8.

Measurements for water sub-saturated conditions used a hygroscopic tandem differential mobility analyzer (HTDMA). Simultaneously, measurements of particle critical supersaturation were conducted on the same sample stream with a continuous flow cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) counter. For these experiments, we used filter-collected samples of biomass smoke generated in the combustion of two common wildland fire fuels, western sagebrush and Alaskan duff core. Extractions of separate sections of the filter were performed using two solvents, ultrapure water and methanol. The extracts were subsequently atomized, producing aerosols having a range of hygroscopic responses. HTDMA and CCN measurements were fit to a single-parameter model of water uptake, in which the fit parameter is denoted κ, the hygroscopicity parameter. Here, for the four extracts we observed mean values of the hygroscopicity parameter of 0.06 < κ < 0.30, similar to the range found previously for numerous pure organic compounds. Particles generated from the aqueous extracts of the filters had consistently larger κ than methanol extracts, while western sagebrush extract aerosols κ exceeded those from Alaskan duff core. HTDMA- and CCN-derived values of κ for each experiment agreed within approximately 20\%. Applicability of the κ-parameterization to other multicomponent aerosols relevant to the atmosphere remains to be tested.},

	abstract="We present a method to describe the relationship between particle dry diameter and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity using a single hygroscopicity parameter κ. Values of the hygroscopicity parameter are between 0.5 and 1.4 for highly-CCN-active salts such as sodium chloride, between 0.01 and 0.5 for slightly to very hygroscopic organic species, and 0 for nonhygroscopic components. Observations indicate that atmospheric particulate matter is typically characterized by 0.1<κ<0.9. If compositional data are available and if the hygroscopicity parameter of each component is known, a multicomponent hygroscopicity parameter can be computed by weighting component hygroscopicity parameters by their volume fractions in the mixture. In the absence of information on chemical composition, experimental data for complex, multicomponent particles can be fitted to obtain the hygroscopicity parameter. The hygroscopicity parameter can thus also be used to conveniently model the CCN activity of atmospheric particles, including those containing insoluble components. We confirm the applicability of the hygroscopicity parameter and its mixing rule by applying it to published hygroscopic diameter growth factor and CCN-activation data for single- and multi-component particles containing varying amounts of inorganic, organic and surface active compounds. We suggest that κ may be fit to CCN data assuming σs/a=0.072 J m−2 and present a table of κ derived for this value and T=298.15 K. The predicted hygroscopicities for mixtures that contain the surfactant fulvic acid agree within uncertainties with the measured values. It thus appears that this approach is adequate for predicting CCN activity of mixed particles containing surface active materials, but the generality of this assumption requires further verification.",

	journal = {Aerosol Science and Technology},
	abstract = {Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) instruments determine the so-called “critical diameter” for activation of particles into cloud droplets at a fixed water supersaturation. A differential mobility analyzer is often used to size-select particles for purposes of scanning for the critical diameter. Usually the diameter where 50% of the particles have activated to cloud droplets is assumed to be equal to the critical diameter. We introduce a model that describes the transfer of polydisperse charge-equilibrated particles through an ideal differential mobility analyzer followed by transit through an ideal CCN instrument. We show that if the mode diameter of the polydisperse size distribution exceeds the critical diameter of the particles, multiply-charged particles may lead to nonmonotonic CCN counter response curves (plots of CCN-active fraction vs. mobility diameter) that exhibit multiple peaks, rather than a simple sigmoidally-shaped curve. Hence, determination of the 50% activation diameter is ambiguous. Multiply-charged particles significantly skew the CCNc response curves when sampling particles with critical diameters exceeding 0.1 μ m from particle size distributions with mode diameters also larger than the critical diameter. We present a method for inversion of CCN counter data that takes multiple-charging effects into account, and demonstrate its application to laboratory data. Our calculated CCN counter response curves are in good agreement with observations, and can be used to infer the critical activation diameter for a specified supersaturation.},

	abstract = {Owens lake bed is one of the largest sources of particulate matter in the western hemisphere. Because of the fine-grained nature of this dust, it is easily lofted above the atmospheric boundary layer, where it may affect cloud formation. Further, unlike many other soil types, it has a large fraction of soluble material (∼3–37\% of the mass on an organic-matter-free basis), so it can impact both warm and cold clouds. In this study, we measure the hygroscopicity, cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) activity, and ice nucleating ability of Owens (dry) Lake dust. Our studies confirm that a fraction of the Owens (dry) Lake dust (35\% by number for particle sizes ∼200 nm) is quite hygroscopic and has CCN activity comparable to that of sodium chloride (50 nm particles activate at 0.33\% supersaturation). These hygroscopic dust particles can readily initiate droplet formation at modest supersaturations in the atmosphere and may significantly impact liquid clouds in the southwestern United States. The less hygroscopic fraction had only modest CCN activity. However, such particles may still activate as cloud droplets at atmospheric supersaturations and could potentially modify cloud properties if particles with diameters larger than ∼300 nm are present. The less hygroscopic fraction also was found to nucleate ice heterogeneously at relative humidities significantly lower than required for homogeneous freezing of aqueous particles at temperatures colder than −40°C. In convective systems, this dust may be lofted to the upper troposphere where it may impact convection strength and onset conditions for ice formation in cold clouds.},

SOA precursors included α-pinene, β-pinene, Δ3-carene, and toluene, representative of both naturally and anthropogenically emitted organic species. Measured CCN activation was comparable for all of the species studied and occurred at humidity conditions which are readily attained in the atmosphere. Further, there was little variation in hygroscopic growth between compounds. However, measured droplet activation conditions were inconsistent with hygroscopicity measured below water saturation and Köhler theory expressions based on Raoult’s law for several parameterizations for water activity. In the atmosphere, SOA may compose a large fraction of atmospheric particulate matter and will often exist internally mixed with inorganic species. Using the current results, we compare SOA to insoluble organic species to calculate CCN activation from mixed organic-sulfate particles for a range of atmospheric conditions. We find that droplet activation behavior of mixed particles containing SOA is the same as that of mixed particles for which the organic component is nonhygroscopic, except for cases in which there are low particle concentrations, low updraft velocities, and the aerosol composition is dominated by organics.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT High-molecular-weight organic compounds represent an important fraction in atmospheric aerosols, but their interactions with atmospheric water vapour are not well understood. Specifically, the hygroscopicity of polymerized atmospheric aerosols is larger than expected for their high molecular weights and is not a strong function of the degree of polymerization, but their cloud-nucleating activity declines as polymerization progresses. We apply a Flory–Huggins based theory for polymer–water interactions to describe water activity in aqueous solutions of atmospherically relevant oligomers and polymers, and show via experiments on particles composed of commercial polymers that it is consistent with observed particle hygroscopic growth and cloud formation behaviour.},

	abstract = "Two thermal diffusion cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) instruments were intercompared using a nearly monodisperse test aerosol composed of sodium chloride and ammonium sulfate. The main objective of this work is the determination of the maximum steady-state supersaturation within a thermal diffusion chamber. This required analysis of the uncertainties associated with the calibration of the instrument’s plate temperature and light scattering measurement systems. The fraction of test particles activating to form cloud droplets, the activated fraction, was evaluated over a range of dry particle diameters at four supersaturations. Values of both the particle size, corresponding to an activated fraction equal to 0.5, and the width of a fitted activation function were derived. The former was used to evaluate the maximum steady-state chamber supersaturation. These studies reveal three significant findings. First, the derived chamber supersaturation is ∼40% smaller than values based on temperature measured at the top and bottom of the diffusion chamber. Second, using deliquesced test particles, mobility selected at a prescribed relative humidity, it is shown that the 40% discrepancy is not the result of a test particle shape effect. Third, the width of the activation function is substantially larger than the width of the test particle size spectra. Plausible explanations for the 40% bias are considered. Contributors are the unintentional overestimation of the temperature difference imposed across the CCN chamber and the implicit assumption that water at the top and bottom of the CCN chamber has a vapor pressure equal to that over pure water.",

	abstract = {We examine the cloud condensation nucleation behavior expected for dry submicron particles composed of organic species having limited solubility in water and thus exhibiting deliquescence only under water-supersaturated conditions. If saturated solution water activities aw are approximately 0.97 < aw < 1, then deliquescence is likely to control the supersaturation required to activate submicron particles, leading to high sensitivity of critical supersaturation to dry diameter. Similar behavior may occur for species, including polymeric compounds, that exhibit limited miscibility in water until very dilute conditions. Treating the sparingly-soluble or limited-miscibility species as insoluble aerosol components in calculations of their hygroscopic growth does not reproduce the predicted strong dependence of critical supersaturation on dry particle size. Lack of information on the solubility characteristics of organic-species-dominated atmospheric particulate matter may thus lead to discrepancies between predicted and measured droplet activation, even when particle composition and size are well-constrained by measurements.},

The cloud field is distinguished by the presence of pockets of open cells. Differences between the pockets and the surrounding stratocumulus clouds are studied utilizing in situ and satellite data. The pockets are characterized as regions where cloud radar echo tops are unusually variable, accumulation mode aerosol concentrations are low, and Aitken mode particles with a mode diameter at 0.02 μm dominate aerosol number concentration. The Aitken mode particles are thought to be generated by a nucleation event which occurred within the marine boundary layer. The low accumulation mode concentrations associated with the pockets are proposed to be necessary for their maintenance.},

	abstract = {Data from nine stratocumulus clouds in the northeastern Pacific Ocean were analyzed to determine the effect of aerosol particles on cloud microphysical and radiative properties. Seven nighttime and two daytime cases were included. The number concentration of below-cloud aerosol particles (>0.10 μm diameter) was highly correlated with cloud droplet number concentration. Droplet number concentrations were typically about 75\% of particle number concentration in the range of particle concentrations studied (≤400 cm−3). Particle number was anticorrelated with droplet size and with liquid water content in drizzle-sized drops. Radiative impact also depends upon cloud liquid water content and geometric thickness. Although most variability in these macroscopic properties of the clouds could be attributed to variability in the large-scale environment, a weak anticorrelation between particle concentration and cloud geometric thickness was observed. Because of these variations, no correlation between calculated cloud optical thickness or albedo and particle concentration was detectable for the data set as a whole. For regions with comparable liquid water contents in an individual cloud, higher particle concentrations did correspond to increased cloud optical thickness. These results verify that higher particle concentrations do directly affect the microphysics of stratiform clouds. However, the constant liquid water path assumption usually invoked in the Twomey aerosol indirect effect may not be valid.},

The field program consisted of nine flights in marine stratocumulus west-southwest of San Diego, California. The objective of the program was to better understand the physics a n d dynamics of marine stratocumulus. Toward this end special flight strategies, including predominantly nocturnal flights, were employed to optimize estimates of entrainment velocities at cloud-top, large-scale divergence within the boundary layer, drizzle processes in the cloud, cloud microstructure, and aerosol–cloud interactions. Cloud conditions during DYCOMS-II were excellent with almost every flight having uniformly overcast clouds topping a well-mixed boundary layer. Although the emphasis of the manuscript is on the goals and methodologies of DYCOMS-II, some preliminary findings are also presented—the most significant being that the cloud layers appear to entrain less and drizzle more than previous theoretical work led investigators to expect.",
