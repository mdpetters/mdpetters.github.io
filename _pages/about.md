Welcome to the Aerosol Group within the Department of Marine Earth and Atmospheric Sciences 
(MEAS) at NC State University. We study the physcical and chemical properties of particles 
between 0.01 and 10 Âµm with a focus on understanding phase transitions. Our work spans instrument 
development, laboratory measurements, field observations, and process-level model 
development.

Please contact me if you are interested in **getting involved in research**. I am currently 
looking for motivated undergraduate and graduate students to join the team.
