<p>The groups of Ziemann (CU Boulder), Petters (NC State University), and DeMott (Colorado State University) 
are funded by the DOE-ASR program to conduct laboratory measurements to link viscosity and ice nucleation. 
The overall objectives of that project are (1) measure the effects of molecular structure, temperature, and 
relative humidity on the viscosity of organic aerosol formed via controlled laboratory experiments, 
(2) assess the critical viscosity where semisolid SOA surfaces lose their heterogeneous 
ice nucleation properties as RH increases, and (3) develop computationally inexpensive expressions 
to demarcate regions where aerosols are liquid, semisolid, glassy, and/or ice nucleation active.</p>

      <p>Electrostatic precipitators are devices that remove charged particles from an air stream. We present the design and characterization of an electrostatic precipitator that is intended to be incorporated into aerosol sampling equipment. Hardware and software components of the design are open, all components can be directly purchased from vendors, and the device can be assembled with standard tools. Generic components are used to allow the repurposing of parts for other uses. The computer-controlled high-voltage power supply box associated with the project can be used for other common high-voltage applications in Aerosol Science and Technology, such as data acquisition and control systems for scanning mobility particle sizers. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to quantify the 3D flow field. The transfer function associated with the partial transmission is characterized through modeling and experiments. The observed transfer function is unique but deviates from the ideal transfer function due to the distortion of the flow near the inlet and the outlet of the device. Singly charged particles up to 624 nm and 253 nm can be completely removed for 0.5 L min−1 and 1 L min−1, respectively. We anticipate that our device will increase the accessibility of the technique to a broader audience.</p>

      <p>Atmospheric aerosols can exist in amorphous semi-solid or glassy phase states whose viscosity varies with atmospheric temperature and relative humidity. The temperature and humidity dependence of viscosity has been hypothesized to be predictable from the combination of a water-organic binary mixing rule of the glass transition temperature, a glass transition temperature scaled viscosity fragility parameterization, and a water uptake parameterization. This work presents a closure study between predicted and observed viscosity for sucrose and citric acid. Viscosity and glass transition temperature as a function of water content are compiled from literature data and used to constrain the fragility parameterization. New measurements characterizing viscosity of sub-100 nm particles using the dimer relaxation method are presented. These measurements extend the available data of temperature and humidity dependent viscosity to −28 ºC. Predicted relationships agree well with observations at room temperature and with measured isopleths of constant viscosity at  107 Pa s and warmer than −28 ºC. Discrepancies at colder temperatures are observed for sucrose particle. Simulations with the kinetic multi-layer model of gas-particle interactions suggest that the observed deviations at colder temperature for sucrose can be attributed to kinetic limitations associated with water uptake at the timescales of the dimer relaxation experiments. Using the available information, updated equilibrium phase-state diagrams (−80 ºC &lt; T &lt; 40 ºC and 0 &lt; RH &lt; 100 %) for sucrose and citric acid are constructed and associated equilibration timescales are identified.</p>

      <p>Atmospheric aerosols can assume liquid, amorphous semi-solid or glassy, and crystalline phase states. Particle phase state plays a critical role in understanding and predicting aerosol impacts on human health, visibility, cloud formation, and climate. Melting point depression increases with decreasing particle diameter and is predicted by the Gibbs–Thompson relationship. This work reviews existing data on the melting point depression to constrain a simple parameterization of the process. The parameter ξ describes the degree to which particle size lowers the melting point and is found to vary between 300 and 1800 K nm for a wide range of particle compositions. The parameterization is used together with existing frameworks for modeling the temperature and RH dependence of viscosity to predict the influence of particle size on the glass transition temperature and viscosity of secondary organic aerosol formed from the oxidation of α-pinene. Literature data are broadly consistent with the predictions. The model predicts a sharp decrease in viscosity for particles less than 100 nm in diameter. It is computationally efficient and suitable for inclusion in models to evaluate the potential influence of the phase change on atmospheric processes. New experimental data of the size-dependence of particle viscosity for atmospheric aerosol mimics are needed to thoroughly validate the predictions.</p>

      <p>Nanoscale dimers have application in studies of aerosol physicochemical properties such as aerosol viscosity. These particle dimers can be synthesized using the dual tandem differential mobility analyzer (DTDMA) technique, wherein oppositely charged particle streams coagulate to form dimers that can be isolated using electrostatic filtration. Although some characterization of the technique has been published, a detailed thesis on the modes and theory of operation has remained outside the scope of prior work. Here, we present new experimental data characterizing the output DTDMA size distribution and the physical processes underlying its apparent modes. Key experimental limitations for both general applications and for viscosity measurements are identified and quantified in six distinct types of DTDMA experiments. The primary consideration is the production of an adequate number of dimers, which typically requires high mobility-selected number concentration in the range 25,000–100,000 cm−3. The requisite concentration threshold depends upon the rate of spontaneous monomer decharging, which arises predominately from interactions of the aerosol with ionizing radiation within the coagulation chamber and is instrument location dependent. Lead shielding of the coagulation chamber reduced the first-order decharging constant from ∼2.0 × 10−5 s−1 to ∼0.8 × 10−5 s−1 in our laboratory. Dimer production at monomer diameters less than 40 nm is hindered by low bipolar charging efficiency. Results from the characterization experiments shed light on design considerations for general applications and for characterization of viscous aerosol phase transitions.</p>

      <p>Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a complex mixture of largely unspeciated compounds. The volatility and viscosity of the bulk organic aerosol influence new particle formation, processing, and lifetime in the atmosphere. Relationships between these properties are well-defined for pure compounds but currently unavailable for bulk organic aerosol. In this survey study, we characterized SOA formed from a range of biogenic precursors and conditions in an oxidation flow reactor for volatility (thermodenuder), viscosity (dimer coagulation, isolation, and coalescence), and oxidation state (aerosol chemical speciation monitor). We find linear trends in log–linear and log–log plots of single-parameter representations of volatility and viscosity, with higher condensed-phase fractions of extremely low and low volatility material associated with an increased viscosity (R = 0.69). Per this relationship, an increase in the contribution of these fractions (i.e., lower volatility) by 0.1 results in an increase in viscosity of approximately 200%. The viscosity (at 30 °C) of SOA fell between 6.2 × 105 and 8.0 × 108 Pa s and thus in the semisolid range. The SOA oxidation state ranged from −1.0 and 0.1 and was weakly anticorrelated with volatility (but not viscosity). We found larger SOA mass loadings generally associated with increased volatility and decreased viscosity. The results of this preliminary study are consistent with “molecular corridor”-style frameworks employing molecular mass and volatility to estimate the viscosity of bulk real-world SOA.</p>

      <p>A language for computation of differential mobility analyzer (DMA) response functions is introduced. The language consists of short programming language expressions that evaluate to the size distribution of particles exiting a DMA. The language permits application of the same framework to single and tandem DMA setups. Expressions are derived for calculation of the convolution matrix used in inversion of size distribution data, calculation of the convolution matrix for transit through tandem DMA systems, and calculation of the size and mobility distribution through DMA systems that involve one or multiple DMAs. The contribution of multiply charged particles to the total response distributions can be explicitly resolved. The derived convolution matrix is suitable for inverting scanning mobility particle sizer response functions using standard regularization techniques. Users can modify and substitute any of the convolution terms—comprising the DMA transfer function, detector efficiency, loss rate, and charging efficiencies—to express response functions of nonstandard DMA configurations. Example applications are presented, including classification of particle size, measurement of size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei activity, characterization of hygroscopicity and volatility tandem DMA response functions, and characterization of the dual tandem DMA system for dimer preparation. The source code and examples are shared as free software and are hosted on an online collaborative software development platform that allows for version tracking and crediting contributors. Adoption of the language may facilitate the design and optimization of custom-built systems that involve unique arrangements of DMAs and detectors.</p>
