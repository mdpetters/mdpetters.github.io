    <h4 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h4>
<p>In the absence of a nucleus, water does not freeze at temperatures below zero Celsius. Substances
that cause supercooled water to freeze play a central role in cloud physics. Our group 
measures the concentration of freezing nuclei in the atmosphere using a cold-stage technique.
The experiment is performed by placing droplets on surface which is observed by a camera.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/dropsize.png" alt="drawing" width="780"></p>

<p><strong>Figure.</strong> Drop volumes used by the NC State CS. (a) A section of the field of view for an 
experiment using ~0.25 nL immersed in oil. The small images to the right depict enlarged 
examples of individual drops prior to freezing (left column) and after freezing (right column), 
(b) same as (a) but for ~150 nL immerserd in oil, (c) 1 muL placed on four hydrophobic 
glass slides. Drops are placed using an electronic pipette. Images in (a) and (b) are 
obtained using a stereo microscope, the images in (c) with a macro lens.</p>

<p>The surface is cooled at a constant rate. Time lapse photography is used to record images 
of the drops every few s. When the droplets freeze, they turn opaque. The change in brightness 
is detected using an automated image detection code.</p>

<h4 id="software">Software</h4>

<p>The code in this repository is used for analysis for 1 ul volume drops shown in the right
part of the figure above. Each image is compared to the next colder image with a darkening of the 
drop indicating a freeze event. Detection occurs in three steps. First, drop locations are 
identified in the first image in the sequence using a Hough transform for circles. After 
the location of the drops is identified, each drop location is compared to the same location 
in the next image by taking a subset of the image including the drop and then 
performing the following steps: convert the two tiles to grayscale equivalents, subtract the 
two tiles from each other, convert the grayscale result to a binary image based on a 
threshold value, and finally perform cleanup.</p>

      <p>The sources and concentrations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) over India are not well known. Here, INP concentrations in rainwater from Northern India and a dust sample from the Thar Desert are characterized. Rainwater INP concentrations ranged between 10e4 and 3 × 10e7 L−1 water, spanning temperatures between −4 and −28 °C. During the monsoon season, INP concentrations were low and approached those in remote marine air mass. During the winter season, INPs active between −4 to −10 °C were occasionally observed. An increase in INP activity sometimes occurred after the initial onset of rain. The onset freezing temperature of samples active at warmer temperatures was shifted to colder temperature after heat treatment, suggesting that the INP activity stemmed from biological influence. Plating was used to isolate and sequence INP active bacterial strains from some of the rainwater samples, specifically strains of close taxonomic affiliation with the ice nucleating genera Pantoea. The size-resolved ice nucleation active site density for 200–600-nm particles of Thar Desert Dust ranged between 10e7 and 10e9 m−2 at −20 °C, values similar to dusts from other regions of the world. The data reported herein may help constrain models that seek to predict the impact of INP on the properties of mixed-phased clouds over the Indian subcontinent.</p>

      <p>We present the laboratory results of immersion freezing efficiencies of cellulose particles at supercooled temperature (T) conditions. Three types of chemically homogeneous cellulose samples are used as surrogates that represent supermicron and submicron ice-nucleating plant structural polymers. These samples include microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), fibrous cellulose (FC) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC). Our immersion freezing dataset includes data from various ice nucleation measurement techniques available at 17 different institutions, including nine dry dispersion and 11 aqueous suspension techniques. With a total of 20 methods, we performed systematic accuracy and precision analysis of measurements from all 20 measurement techniques by evaluating T-binned (1 ∘C) data over a wide T range (−36 ∘C &lt;T&lt;−4 ∘C). Specifically, we intercompared the geometric surface area-based ice nucleation active surface site (INAS) density data derived from our measurements as a function of T, ns,geo(T). Additionally, we also compared the ns,geo(T) values and the freezing spectral slope parameter (Δlog(ns,geo)/ΔT) from our measurements to previous literature results. Results show all three cellulose materials are reasonably ice active. The freezing efficiencies of NCC samples agree reasonably well, whereas the diversity for the other two samples spans ≈ 10 ∘C. Despite given uncertainties within each instrument technique, the overall trend of the ns,geo(T) spectrum traced by the T-binned average of measurements suggests that predominantly supermicron-sized cellulose particles (MCC and FC) generally act as more efficient ice-nucleating particles (INPs) than NCC with about 1 order of magnitude higher ns,geo(T).</p>

      <p>An emerging and unsolved question is the sensitivity of cloud processes, precipitation, and climate to the atmospheric ice nucleus spectrum. This work revisits estimation of atmospheric ice-nucleating particle concentration derived from cloud water and precipitation samples representing a wide range of geographical locations, seasons, storm systems, precipitation types, instruments, concentrations, and temperatures. Concentrations of ice-nucleating particles are shown to vary over 10 orders of magnitude. High variability is observed in the −5°C to −12°C range which is suggested to be biologically derived nuclei whose life cycle is associated with intermittent source and efficient sink processes. The highest ever observed nucleus concentrations at −8°C are 3 orders of magnitude lower than observed ice crystal concentrations in tropical cumuli at the same temperature. The observed upper and lower limits of the nucleus spectrum provide a possible constraint on minimum enhancement factors for secondary ice formation processes.</p>

      <p>Ice nucleating particles (INP) are particles that play a critical role in the formation of mixed phase clouds. The INP initiate glaciation which disturbs the colloidal equilibrium of the suspended supercooled drops and, in turn, results in precipitation (Pruppacher and Klett 1996). Ice crystals are frequently observed at temperatures warmer than −15°C (Murray et al. 2012) and biologically-derived particles are a plausible source of INP in this temperature regime (Möhler et al. 2007; Prenni et al. 2009). Biological particles have been identified in cloud ice-crystal residues (Pratt et al. 2009), rain and snow (Christner et al. 2008), and ground-level air surrounding rain (Huffman et al. 2013; Prenni et al. 2013). Nonetheless, the role of biological ice nuclei in cloud glaciation remains elusive because direct links between emission and cloud ingestion processes have not been identified. Here we present observations from case studies that suggest that the active release of biological INP is causally coordinated with the arrival of a cold-frontal boundary, which lofts the nuclei to seed the frontal cloud band.</p>

      <p>Recent studies have suggested that the ice-nucleating ability of some types of pollen is derived from non-proteinaceous macromolecules. These macromolecules may become dispersed by the rupturing of the pollen grain during wetting and drying cycles in the atmosphere. If true, this mechanism might prove to be a significant source of ice nuclei (IN) concentrations when pollen is present. Here we test this hypothesis by measuring ambient IN concentrations from the beginning to the end of the 2013 pollen season in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. Air samples were collected using a swirling aerosol collector twice per week and the solutions were analysed for ice nuclei activity using a droplet freezing assay. Rainwater samples were collected at times when pollen grain number concentrations were near their maximum value and analysed with the drop-freezing assay to compare the potentially enhanced IN concentrations measured near the ground with IN concentrations found aloft. Ambient ice nuclei spectra, defined as the number of ice nuclei per volume of air as a function of temperature, are inferred from the aerosol collector solutions. No general trend was observed between ambient pollen grain counts and observed IN concentrations, suggesting that ice nuclei multiplication via pollen grain rupturing and subsequent release of macromolecules was not prevalent for the pollen types and meteorological conditions typically encountered in the southeastern US. A serendipitously sampled collection after a downpour provided evidence for a rain-induced IN burst with an observed IN concentration of approximately 30 per litre, a 30-fold increase over background concentrations at −20 °C. The onset temperature of freezing for these particles was approximately −12 °C, suggesting that the ice-nucleating particles were biological in origin.</p>

      <p>We present new measurements of the time dependence of the ice-nucleating ability of a wide range of materials including the minerals montmorillonite and kaolinite, the biological proxy ice nuclei Icemax, and flame soot generated from the incomplete combustion of ethylene gas. We also present time dependence for ambient ice nuclei collected from rainwater samples. Our data show that the time dependence for all materials studied here is weak, suggesting that the modified singular approximation is valid over the range of times and temperatures encountered for mixed phase clouds.</p>

      <p>A small fraction of particles in the atmosphere can catalyze ice formation in cloud water drops through heterogeneous freezing nucleation at temperatures warmer than the homogeneous freezing temperature of approximately −38°C. The rate for heterogeneous freezing nucleation is dependent on several factors, including the type and surface area of dust that is immersed inside the drop. Although nucleation is an inherently stochastic process resulting from size fluctuations of the incipient ice germ, there is a growing body of literature that suggests that quasi-deterministic models of ice nucleation can describe laboratory experiments. Here we present new experiments and simulations that aim to better constrain theoretical models fitted to laboratory data. We collected ice nucleation data for Arizona Test Dust aerosol immersed in water using a droplet freezing assay setup that allows for the cooling rates to be changed between 10 and 0.01 K min−1. Discrete event simulations based on a variant of the multiple-component stochastic model of heterogeneous freezing nucleation were used to simulate different experimental procedures. The nucleation properties of the dust are specified by four material-dependent parameters that accurately describe the time dependence of the freezing process. We anticipate that the combination of discrete event simulations and a spectrum of experimental procedures described here can be used to design more meaningful laboratory experiments probing ice nucleation and will aid the development of better parameterizations for use in models.</p>
